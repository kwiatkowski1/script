Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale for Android


Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale is a free-to-play battle royale game for Android. If you’ve played any other battle royale titles, you know the drill: You and your opponents will be transported to a remote island where you fight to the death and hope to be the last man standing. This is one of the most exciting offline battle royale titles on the market for mobile devices.


In terms of gameplay, Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale has a lot in common with other battle royale android games such as Garena Free Fire MAX and Star Wars: Hunters. While the premise of these games is pretty much the same, each has its own gimmick and special gameplay elements to bring to the table.


A single-player shooter


The terms single-player and battle royale don’t usually mix. Battle royale typically involves a number of other players that are all battling for the same thing -- to be the last man standing in a predetermined and typically small area. However, Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale has taken a slightly different approach to the battle royale genre, one that is far more inclusive to players who don’t have a stable internet connection. In this mode, you’ll battle computer-generated bots of various difficulty levels in the typical battle royale setup.


Multiplayer mode


Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale also features a competitive multiplayer mode that you can play when you have a stable internet connection. During this mode, instead of battling against computer-generated opponents, you’ll go head to head with other players. You can either play privately with your friends, or you can opt to play against other players worldwide.


The multiplayer mode in Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale is much more realistic in terms of true battle royale gameplay, and you’ll need to outsmart or outgun your opponents if you want to win the individual matches. Multiplayer mode also lets you form strike teams of up to four players.


Loads of loot


Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale has a wide selection of weapons and ammunition, which you’ll need to take full advantage of in order to win the game. In addition to the usual weapons such as guns and weapons, for hand-to-hand combat, you’ll also encounter more interesting ways to end your opponent’s games. These include but are not limited to turrets, drones, and even tanks and giant robots. In addition to weaponry, Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale also has a decent catalogue of protective gear. These include energy shields and loads of armour.


An exciting battle royale alternative


There are definitely better-developed battle royale titles for Android, but Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale does the job you’d expect it to do. While the graphics and environment might not be as visually appealing as alternatives like Garena Free Fire, Fire Force: Gun Battle Royale is a well-made, free, and offline alternative to the more popular battle royale titles.
