Play Solitaire Turn 3 online - for free!


Play solitaire where 3 cards are drawn from the stockpile at once. This is a more difficult version of the game since you can only play every third card from the stockpile. If you’re able to play that card, you can then play the next card of the two that are remaining, and if you can do that, you can play the last card remaining. If you can’t play are these three cards, they are moved to the waste, and you draw three more cards. You can see in this example how three cards are turned from the stockpile.


In Turn 1 solitaire, you draw or deal one card from the stockpile at each time. This allows you to play every card from the stockpile making it easier version of solitaire.

10 best solitaire games for Android


Solitaire is one of the classic, old school card games. You can find it for mobile phones pretty easily. Here are the best.


Solitaire is one of the classic card games. It’s around 300 years old, if not older. The game has changed very little since its inception, but there are several variants, like FreeCell and TriPeaks. Luckily, it’s a relatively easy game to code. There are an absolute ton of solitaire options in the Google Play Store. We think we’ve narrowed down a good list of the best solitaire games for Android.


Best solitaire games for Android:


250+ Solitaire Collection


Price: Free / $2.99


250+ Solitaire Collection is a collection of solitaire games. It has the basic solitaire along with FreeCell, TriPeaks, Klondike, Canfield, Golf, Spider, Scorpion, and many others. The UI isn’t the best, but it’s highly functional and reasonably easy to use. There isn’t much to complain about really. The controls are decent, it has every version of solitaire I’ve ever heard of, and it’s reasonably cheap. The free version contains ads and the full version removes them. It’s also free via Google Play Pass if you have it.


AI Factory Limited’s Solitaire


Price: Free / $3.49


AI Factory Limited is a developer on Google Play with a bunch of old-school games like chess, checkers, hearts, spades, and, of course, solitaire. There is a free version with ads and a separate premium version without them. In terms of gameplay, it’s pretty decent. It’s the classic solitaire experience with some extra options. Those options include difficulty choices, three different scoring options, and whether you want one or three-card draw. The game isn’t packed full of a ton of extras. It just executes the game in a pleasant manner. It’s also free on Google Play Pass.


Brainium Studios solitaire games


Price: Free / $4.99-$11.99


Brainium Studios is another developer on Google Play. This developer has three decent solitaire games. The first is your standard solitaire, the second is a FreeCell variant, and the third is a Spider variant. All three of them are pretty decent. Each one has a healthy selection of options like a difficulty mode and some customization options like one card or three card draw. The regular solitaire game even has a left handed mode. The FreeCell and Spider editions are notably less expensive than the regular, but otherwise all three games play pretty well.


Classic Solitaire Klondike


Price: Free


Classic Solitaire Klondike is the best free solitaire game that we could find. It has no in-app purchases, no ads, and no nonsense. It’s just your basic, classic solitaire. The game has some basic settings. You can switch from one to three card draw. undo and redo a move, and adjust the difficulty. That’s about it but do you really need anything else? It plays offline as well for those times when you’re stuck with no signal. It’s basic, but it’s serviceable and fun.


Microsoft Solitaire Collection


Price: Free / $1.99 per month / $9.99 per year


Microsoft Solitaire Collection is one of the most popular solitaire games on mobile. It’s a mobile port of the popular solitaire games from Microsoft Windows. This one has a ton of extras. It includes regular (Klondike) solitaire along with FreeCell, Spider, TriPeaks, and Pyramid. Each game has its own set of options to adjust things like difficulty. The game includes things like daily and weekly challenges and integration with Xbox Live profiles where you can earn actual Xbox achievements. It has a subscription price and we’re not fans of subscription prices for card games. However, you can play all the solitaire you want without it as long as you don’t mind some ads.
