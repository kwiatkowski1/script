Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battel overview


Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle is a popular battle game available on Android devices. Similar to the popular game Clash of Clans, players must build a team of characters and defeat their opponents in order to win points. The game can be downloaded for free from the Google Play store.


The objective of Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle is to collect cards with characters from the Dragon Ball franchise. To play Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle, simply open the app and select a battle arena. Players will then be able to select their team of characters and begin battling against others. Different arenas have different rules that must be followed in order to win, such as collecting items or taking down specific buildings. Players can also earn extra bonuses by meeting certain requirements during each battle.


Defeat the enemy With One Touch


When it comes to Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle, one of the things that players can do is build strong teams and defeat the enemy with one touch. In this game, players can take control of their favorite characters from the Dragon Ball series and battle against other players. There are a variety of ways to win in this game, but defeating the enemy with one touch is a big part of it.


Unleash super powerful special moves


Super powerful special moves are a big part of Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle, and they can be unleashed by tapping on a character’s icon in the battle screen. Each fighter has a unique set of super moves, and players need to use them wisely in order to defeat their opponents.


There are two types of super moves: regular and ultimate. Regular super moves deal more damage than ultimate super moves, but they’re also less damaging overall. Players need to weigh their options carefully before using a regular or ultimate super move, as the right one for the situation can mean the difference between victory and defeat.


Players can also unleash supers with ki blasts, which are fired from characters’ hands. These attacks are powerful but limited in number, so players need to be selective about when to use them. If used too early in a match, Ki blasts may not have enough power to take down an enemy. But if used at the right time, they can devastate an opponent’s health bar completely.

The best part is that you don’t need to worry about energy restrictions – as long as you have enough stones, you can battle as long as you want!


To start off your dream battle, select one of your favorite characters from the show. From here, it’s time for some strategy. You’ll want to choose a team of characters who complement each other well and strategy together.
