Narwhale.io is a game about friendly narwhals cutting each other in half with their tusks. Each time you kill someone, you level up at least one level and get an upgrade. You can rise through the leaderboard and become the King if you kill enough narwhals. No matter how many levels you have, if you die, you reset to level one. There are also different gamemodes like FFA, Narwhale Ball, Narwhale Egg Hunt, and Team Deathmatch. You can upgrade your tusk, dash speed, stamina, stamina regeneration, and speed with upgrades.
