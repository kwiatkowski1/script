iOS / tvOS Installation Guide


The following is a non-developer guide to install RetroArch on non-jailbroken iOS devices. We're going to try to improve the process and possibly include the iOS cores in a download, but until then, here is a way to build RetroArch to get it running on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV.


Building From Source using Xcode


This is probably the most straightforward way to install RetroArch without having to resort to 3rd party tools. It does however require:


Download Xcode from the Mac App Store.


Clone the RetroArch repository


Open Terminal (it's in Applications/Utilities) and run the following command:


Download the Emulator Cores


Emulator cores are needed to use RetroArch as they contain the code that drives the emulation of the system of the game you want to play.


Normally you'd compile the cores, but since you're not a developer, I'll provide a link to my personal set of precompiled cores for iOS: Download Cores from Mega.nz


Unzip the above archive of cores into the following directory in the RetroArch project: pkg/apple/iOS/modules. The core files should have the extension of .dylib.


Open RetroArch in Xcode


Open the Xcode project located at pkg/apple/iOS/RetroArch_iOS11.xcodeproj


Sign in with your Apple ID



  
Open Xcode Preferences (Xcode -> Preferences)

  
Click the "Accounts" tab

  
Hit the "+" at the bottom left and choose "Apple ID" and sign in with your Apple ID

  
Once you’ve successfully logged in, a new "Personal Team" with the role "Free" will appear beneath your Apple ID.




You'll need to assign the Developer credentials you just created above to the RetroArch project before you can run it on your device.


Click on the project name, select the target you're interested in (RetroArchiOS11 for iOS, RetroArch TV) and change the "Team" to the role you created above.


Then choose your run target (RetroArch iOS Release for iOS, RetroArch tvOS for AppleTV) and build and run:


On the iPhone and iPad, you'll be presented with a touch interface. If you have an mFi controller, you can control the interface that way as well.


On the Apple TV, you'll be shown the "XMB" (PS3-like) interface. You need to use an mFi controller with an Apple TV. The Siri Remote is not supported yet.


When you first start RetroArch, you'll notice that you're missing images. You'll want to run the Online Updater:



  
From the main menu, choose "Online Updater"

  
Choose:

  
Update Core Info Files

  
Update Assets

  
Update Databases

  
Update Overlays

  
Update GLSL Shaders




Changing the Menu Interface


If you want more visual flair in the interface, you can change it by going to "Settings" -> "Driver" -> "Menu Driver". You might need to restart to see it take effect.


Transferring ROMS 
 
iOS 
Use a 3rd party utility like iFunBox or iExplorer to transfer ROM files to the RetroArch app directory.


When you start RetroArch, you'll be presented with a screen with a web address that you can access on your computer to transfer files to the RetroArch app directory on your Apple TV.

That’s it! Congrats to you for your hard work installing RetroArch on your iPhone. Now it’s the time for you to enjoy playing all those retro games straight from your iPhone, anywhere anytime you like.


Play better with Controller!


While you can always use the touchscreen of the iPhone, but for greater fun and enjoyment, I would recommend you to play the games with the Controller using physical buttons – so the experience is (almost) the same like the original. Just in case you need recommendation, here they are. I am personally using Nimbus and DualShock 4 to play the games.
