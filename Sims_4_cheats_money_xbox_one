The Sims 4 money cheat is a time-honored tradition, and Xbox One and PS4 players can get in on the fun too.


The Sims 4 money cheat is a time-honored tradition, and Xbox One and PS4 players can get in on the fun too. Sometimes it’s fun to micromanage your Sim’s household and earn money the usual way, but sometimes you just want to build an extravagant mansion without worrying about your family starving to death. Below we’ve detailed how to use the money cheat in Sims 4 on PS4 and Xbox One and a few things to keep in mind if you choose to use it.



How to Enter Money Cheat: Sims 4 PS4 and Xbox One


To enter into cheat mode in Sims 4 on PS4 or Xbox One you need to have the household you want to give the money to loaded and in Live Mode. To open the cheat entry line you’ll need to press L1, L2, R1, R2, at the same time on PS4, or LT, LB, RB, RT, on the Xbox One. After the line appears, you should see an onscreen keyboard, and you can activate cheat mode by typing testingcheats on into the blank.


After you activate cheat mode, it will return you to the live screen, and you’ll need to reactivate the entry blank by pressing the shoulder buttons on your controller again. Once you’re back at the command line, you can enter the cheats below for some quick cash.


Can I Get Trophies and Achievements if I Use Cheats in Sims 4 on PS4 and Xbox One?


One of the negative aspects of using cheats in The Sims 4 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is that it disables the ability to get achievements and trophies on that household’s save. Even if you disable cheat mode, later on, you can’t start earning them, so make sure that’s an ability you want to give up before you turn cheat mode on.
