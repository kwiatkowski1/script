Virtual Droid 2 Android


Meet people and explore virtual worlds with your avatar


Virtual Droid 2 provides a virtual world that we can travel through to meet people. We will be able to connect to servers in our language or to a global one in which we will meet other avatars we can build a relationship with.


An app to meet people in-game


This application is halfway between a game and a social network similar to Zepeto. Although here the options to configure our own avatar are more limited, it's true that we will be able to meet people with total freedom: all we need to do is move around the room and try to interact with other users.
