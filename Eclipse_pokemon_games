Solgaleo and Lunala Debut during Pokémon GO’s Astral Eclipse Event


Enjoy the stellar power of Alola’s Legendary Pokémon, celestial-themed wild encounters, and avatar items that are out of this world.


 P okémon GO’s Astral Eclipse event will grace the nebula skies (and the earth below) until November 28, 2022, at 8:00 p.m. local time. Starting with this event, Trainers will be able to evolve Cosmoem for the first time in Pokémon GO! The next step of the Season-long Special Research, A Cosmic Companion, will also be unlocked, so prepare for your next adventure alongside Cosmog. Trainers can use 100 Cosmog Candy during the day to evolve Cosmoem into the Sunne Pokémon, Solgaleo, or they can use 100 Cosmog Candy at night to evolve Cosmoem into the Moone Pokémon, Lunala.


Solgaleo and Lunala represent the sun and moon, so Pokémon with ties to celestial bodies and the Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon video games will appear more often. Alolan Rattata, Alolan Sandshrew, Clefairy, Alolan Vulpix, Staryu, Hoothoot, Sunkern, Lunatone, Solrock, Munna, Cottonee, Petilil, and Yungoos will appear more often in the wild. Complete Collection Challenges during the event to receive Stardust that you can use to power up your Pokémon!


Whether you choose to evolve Cosmoem into Solgaleo or Lunala, you’ll be able to accessorize with your new partner with brand-new avatar items. Fly as high as the moon with Lunala Wings and Lunala Pants, or shine bright like the sun with the Solgaleo Mask and Solgaleo Shoes. A pair of nifty Starry Sky Tights will also be available to bring some cosmic style to your next outfit.


With Solgaleo or Lunala by your side, you’ll be more than ready to take on the latest Ultra Beast threat in Pokémon GO. Ultra Beast Arrival: Global will take place on Sunday, November 27, 2022, from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time. Learn more about the event here.


For a full list of Pokémon that will be appearing in the wild, in raids, and as research rewards during the Astral Eclipse event, visit the official Niantic Pokémon GO blog.


Have a stellar time during the Astral Eclipse event, Trainers!

Hi the URL for this game is not working


Its now called Pokemon Eclispe.


its the best website ive ever seen but i was banned for 7 accounts but i would recommend it! im still waiting for a message back from webmaster to see if i can get unbanned.


I've been on TPM for almost 5 years now. I've made amazing friends there. The Root Webmaster is a great person to speak to about the site, or even just in general. As Sankarea and Saphy mentioned, the site is one big family brought together by one awesome guy. The removal of the level cap adds for a new challenge to those who don't find training difficult on other RPGs. Currently, the highest level Pokemon is at level 16,000,000. Differently colored Pokemon, like EmeraldMews, add to the visual factor of the RPG. It also contains Fakemon, such as the fan favorites Mewthree and XD001 (Shadow Lugia from Gale of Darkness), and new ones such as OmegaCelebi and Latimew. And for those who want some nostalgia, the Genesis Pokemon are recolored versions of the original Red/Blue sprites. You can buy and sell Pokemon to and from other users with the site's currency, Platinum Coins. I've said enough, so why don't you stop listening to me babble and try TPM? :)


TPM is probably the best Pokemon RPG out there. It's incredibly unique. Not only does it have catching and training pokemon, just like any other RPG, but what really makes this fun is how there is no level cap, so you don't have lame level 100 pokemon, you can go as high as you wish. TPM offers mining and a minigame centre too, as well as a unique battle story mode, where you learn about the fate of the world. Each pokemon has it's specific rarity, and there are 12 different 'colours' of Pokemon, including Shiny, Legacy and Golden. The site if constantly updated with new events and different available pokemon, which just makes TPM that much more unique. The community is great too. Global chat, forums, commenting on the new updates through the news comments on the website. The community is great to be included in. The staff are great too, so if you have problems, they will be glad to help you get your answer! Even the top-of-the-shop Root Webmaster becomes actively involved with the TPM community every now and again, and when he does, he always brings something different that last time! An overall solid 10/10 website, and I can't wait for the site to grow even more!


LOL. "Something different than last time" indeed. Whenever our dear Root Webmaster comes around, he definitely livens up the place even more, whether it's with music or funny new censors. He creates a fun atmosphere and occasionally discusses plans for future versions! Cless likes to hear what the users have to say as well and takes opinions into account for changes and updates.


XD why did u say loooooooooooooooooool

All the tilesets here are part of an art challenge I gave myself to see how many tilesets I could make in an afternoon. 
The sets are small. But, my intention when making them was that devs would add their own objects/pre-existing ones to the set.


There are six tilesets included in this package. They are free for use for non-commercial projects. 
They have been specifically designed for RPG Maker, making them perfect for anyone using a gen 3 style with their project in Pokémon Essentials.
