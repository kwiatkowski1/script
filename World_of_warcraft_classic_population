World of Warcraft Classic Description


Return to Azeroth from a time long ago… when Level 60 was the cap. In World of Warcraft Classic, players get to play World of Warcraft from its original inception. None of the many expansions of World of Warcraft since 2006 are included. It is essentially World of Warcraft post update patch 1.12, but before The Burning Crusade expansion in 2007.


Players can choose from the 8 original races and the 9 character classes of the Alliance and Horde factions. As noted, the level experience cap is Level 60, which is also reflected in the quests and PVE enemy levels, including raid bosses. Likewise, skills, weapons, armor, and areas available to players are also limited to what was in the original World of Warcraft release. However, this also means that players can obtain items that had become unavailable, due to their removal from later expansions.


However, World of Warcraft Classic does have more modern conveniences, such as an updated UI and removal of bugs that the original World of Warcraft had. Blizzard Entertainment has also released a separate World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic for players who prefer the updates and changes introduced by that first major expansion.


MMO Health


The popularity of World of Warcraft Classic is increasing. In the last 30 days it has increased in player size by 0.069%.
