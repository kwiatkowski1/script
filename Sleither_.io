slither.io will not load.


Been almost a year now, and still the game will not load. Any new help in getting the page to load in chrome?


What operating system are you using and how old is your PC?


windows 10
My PC is about 1 year old.
This happens on all browsers: chrome, firefox, and edge.


I did do what one user posted; and that was to keep refreshing the page over and over and over, and it will eventually load.
(it did actually work) However sometimes you can play for a long while, but other times, the page seems to "timeout" and go blank right in the middle of your game.
it's very frustrating, and I would love to find a true fix for this.

The Original Snake


Snake is one of the most popular mobile phone games of all time. Nokia pioneered this game on its earliest devices. The early games had basic graphics - some even lacked color. But the fact remained - Snake was a trendy and addictive game. It has since spawned an entirely new genre of mobile and web games. You can play the original Snake if you want to relive the beautiful simplicity of the early iterations.
