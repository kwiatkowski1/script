Real Drift


Real Drift is a 3D racing game for Android focused on the world of drifting, where players have to try and win races doing just that, drifting through different closed circuits.


The most important part of games of this nature is the control system, and Real Drift offers two equally good alternatives. You can drive your vehicle and drift using touch controls like the accelerometer on your Android device. You can also use the drifting assistant, which makes controlling the direction relatively simple.


A small downside to Real Drift is its small number of vehicles and tracks, which in addition are all rather similar. Despite this, and thanks to the different competitions and the drift mechanism itself, the game offers hours and hours of varied fun.


Real Drift is a racing game that will particularly delight lovers of drifting. In addition, it has great graphics and above all a great control system that is very well adapted to tactile devices.
