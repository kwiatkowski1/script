But which are the best, tried-and-tested themes for it? Here are 8 of the best GB WhatsApp themes you can download right now.


Part 1: How Do I Change GB WhatsApp Chtas Themes?


Before we talk about the best themes for GB WhatsApp, you must know how to use a theme in the first place.


This section talks about exactly that:




  
Open GB WhatsApp. Tap the 3 dots on the top-right corner and select GBSettings.

  
Find the Download Themes option and select it.

  
Find a theme you like, and hit the Apply button.

  
Your GB WhatsApp app will be restarted to apply the new theme.



Part 2: The Best GB WhatsApp Themes Collection 2023


1. Apple iPhone GB WhatsApp Theme


Many Android users are interested in making their device look like an iPhone, and we don’t blame them. Apps are usually better designed on iPhones. Luckily, if you want to get the “iPhone look” on your Android GBWhatsApp, you can download the iOS theme for GB WhatsApp.


To download it, simply open the Download Themes page in your GB Settings, then search for the iOS theme.


2. ASK Reality Theme


It’s one of the most-used themes in GB WhatsApp today, and for good reasons. It’s clean. It’s minimal. And it isn’t too distracting as some of the other “shiny” themes out there.


Furthermore, if you’re a fan of how Telegram looks, you will enjoy this theme. That’s because the color scheme of this theme matches the color scheme of Telegram.


You can download it from the Download Themes page of GBSettings.


3. Black GB WhatsApp Theme


Another popular GB WhatsApp theme is the Black Theme.


You see, many people are fond of an overall dark look on their phones. However, as you probably know, the default dark mode of WhatsApp isn’t really dark. It’s rather a dark green tint.


With the Black theme, you can get a pitch-black look on your WhatsApp. To download it, head to the Download Themes section in your GB Settings.


4. Material Green Theme


The default green color of WhatsApp is quite boring and dull. Luckily, there are plenty of third-party green themes on GB WhatsApp that you can use. One of the most popular ones of those is the Material Green Theme.


This theme gives your WhatsApp a bright, high-contrast color tint, which you will definitely love. To do this GB/FM WhatsApp theme download, simply search for it in the Download Themes section in GB Settings.


5. Age of Ultron Theme


If you’re a fan of Avengers (who isn’t?), you might enjoy the Age of Ultron theme. This one comes with a beautiful Ultron wallpaper and matching color accents to go along with it. Simply put, you can’t go wrong with it!


To perform GB/Yo Whatsapp themes download for this theme, open the Download Themes section in your GB Settings, then search for it. Or download from ugtechmag.com


6. Material White Theme


Are you a fan of minimalism and simplicity? You might fall in love with this one! It’s a clean, simple, but minimal theme that simplicity-cravers will love. There are no unnecessary color hints here and there, it’s just a clean look.


You can download it from the Download Themes section of GB Settings.


7. iOS Theme


It’s another popular iOS-like theme that people love.


Unlike the last iPhone theme we discussed earlier, this one tries to mimic the iOS version of the official WhatsApp app — and it looks great. If you like a clean, bold, and minimal look, you will love this one.


To download this GB WhatsApp iOS theme, open the Download Themes section in GB Settings.


8.ASK Reality Red Dark


Want the classic ASK theme, but in a more appealing color scheme? This one might fit your needs.


It takes the classic look of the last ASK theme we discussed — and puts a more appealing, Red + Black color palette on top. It looks stylish and clean at the same time.


Again, to perform GB WhatsApp themes download for any of the themes mentioned above, simply search for the respective name in the Download Themes section in GB Settings.
