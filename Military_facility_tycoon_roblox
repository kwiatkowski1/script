How to rebirth fast in Roblox Military Tycoon


Military Tycoon is all about having the biggest and best fortress in the war, so it's important to know how to grow it! The best way to do this is by rebirthing, so we've created this brief guide below that gives our tips and tricks on how to rebirth as fast as possible. Keep in mind, however, that since there are multiple rebirth levels inside of Military Tycoon, you may need to do a bit more or a bit less than someone else who's at a different level.


Rebirthing tips and tricks


What is rebirthing and what does it do?


Each time that you rebirth in Military Tycoon (or in a majority of experiences that offer this feature), you're essentially starting over from scratch—meaning that you lose all of your previously built up progress, stats, and, in the case of Military Tycoon, the entirety of your base. So why would anyone want to do this? The answer is simple—better upgrades and future purchases.


While you may lose all of your hard-earned weapons, vehicles, and equipment after each rebirth, you then gain access to an entirely new and immensely better assortment of items to unlock. These attainable items will continue to get better each time that you rebirth, thus making your character and base stronger in turn.


What do I have to do to rebirth?


In order to rebirth, you need to purchase every single thing available to you inside and outside of your base (yes. everything). This means floor additions, weapons, outfits, armor, vehicles, etc. After you've purchased literally everything that your base has to offer, a rebirth sign will be available to use outside of your base's main building.


Now that you know the basics about rebirthing, continue reading below for some of our tips on how to earn money quickly.


Double Cash gamepass


For those willing to spend the extra money, we'd first suggest purchasing the Double Cash gamepass for 449 Robux, as it permanently doubles your influx of cash from the ATM and thus makes it much easier to save up for future purchases. This gamepass can be purchased in-game at anytime by standing on the yellow button in front of the ATM.


Use codes for even more cash


Another good way to rake in the cash quickly is by entering experience-specific codes, as some of them offer a hefty cash bonus. These codes can be found on our regularly-updated Roblox Military Tycoon code list, on the experience's Twitter account, and in the Military Tycoon Discord.


Use the Tycoon Guide


If you're not interested in spending Robux, which is totally fair, and you've already used all of the active codes, the best and most basic way to help yourself rebirth quickly is to use the experience's Tycoon Guide. This guide is designed to help players keep track of their readily available upgrades and purchases by directing an arrow to whichever features they can afford. This can be a great way to figure out which purchases you have left and what areas you need to focus on.


Capture Fortresses


While capturing fortresses successfully may take a bit of practice, it becomes a decent way to rake in the money XP once you get the hang of it. To find a fortress to take over, leave your base and head toward any of the flags you see floating in the sky—each flag indicates the location of a different base. Depending on the rank of the player whose fortress you're approaching, you may need to bring a variety of offensive weapons with you, and maybe even a tank.


If you want to practice capturing fortresses but don't want to take the extra time fighting someone who's high level, keep your eye out for smaller bases—these will require less effort and take less time to capture.


Capture Oil Rigs


Because of the soldier NPCs that guard the base, you may need to use more stealth when capturing an oil rig than you normally would when capturing a fortress. For the easiest start, be sure to take out any AA guns and Navy soldiers from a distance before heading toward the rig. The best way to do this is by standing on a nearby cliff or mountain and sniping them to not alert the other guards.


Once you've taken out the AA gunners and any other visible soldiers, use either a helicopter or boat to approach the oil rig and board it. To capture an oil rig, locate the flag and interact with it—this will change its ownership to your country and give you a decent stipend in return.
