Wave Defence


Wave Defence is a game mode that was added to Dungeon Quest on May 26th, 2019. It is accessible from the Create Dungeon interface and serves as an alternative to playing in dungeons. In Wave Defence, players must fight off groups of enemies and try to survive as many waves as possible. Just like with dungeons, Wave Defence can be played solo or with a team.


Wave Defence is currently unavailable for Ghastly Harbor, Steampunk Sewers, Orbital Outpost, Volcanic Chambers, Aquatic Temple, Enchanted Forest, Northern Lands and Gilded Skies and trying to create a party on any of these maps results in an error. It is unknown if any of these maps will ever be included in Wave Defence.


On the Join Dungeon interface, Wave Defence parties have a blue tint instead of gray. The party also shows a Wave Defence label in the top left corner of the party listing and does not show the "Hardcore mode" option, since it is not available for Wave Defence.


The questing theme for Wave Defence is called Glorious Heroes.

Gameplay


Hardcore mode is replaced by a respawn system, where any vanquished players can respawn after every 5th wave if at least one person on their team is still alive. Solo matches are effectively still "Hardcore" though, since the respawn mechanic requires at least two players to function.


Waves normally have two hordes of 8 random mobs from the selected dungeon that spawn at two of the four gateways located around the edges of the coliseum. On every 5th wave, an eligible boss from the selected dungeon will spawn in the center of the coliseum.


After every 15th wave, players are given a loot drop and the health and damage of enemies will increase by an additional 25% of their base stats. Health stats for enemies and bosses are also affected by player scaling, with 30% added per player (+0% with 1 total player, +30% with 2 total players, +60% with 3 total players, etc.).


The difference between a normal dungeon party and a wave defence party in the Join Dungeon interface.


Bosses


Due to constraints with the coliseum design and boss mechanics, some bosses are unable to spawn. They are denoted on the table below.


 
Wave Defence Bosses  Dungeon First mini-boss Second mini-boss Main boss  Desert Temple  Desert and Winter do not have any mini-bosses.  Sand Giant  Winter Outpost  Ice Elemental  Pirate Island  Captain Blackbeard Cannot spawn
(Spider Queen) Demonic Pirate Captain  King's Castle  Cannot spawn
(Beast Master) Arch-Mage The King  The Underworld  Demonic Overgrowth Kolvumar Cannot spawn
(Demon Lord Azrallik)  Samurai Palace  Sanada Yukimura Ancient Golem Guardian Miyamoto Musashi  The Canals  Mage Overlord Guardian Overlord Warrior Overlord  



Drops


After every 15 waves, players will receive one random drop from the loot table of the map and difficulty that is being played. Users with the Extra Item game pass receive a second drop. Hardcore mode cannot be applied to a Wave Defence party, which means that three drops is not possible outside of specific events.


Dungeon Cosmetic drops CANNOT be obtained from Wave Defence. 


To see the possible armor, weapon, and ability drops for each map on Wave Defence, please check the respective dungeon's page listed below:


Defender Title Cosmetics


Playing through Wave Defence can allow the player to unlock cosmetic "Defender" titles. These titles can be earned from every map within the Wave Defence game mode. The rarity of the title increases with the amount of completed waves, with a Common title dropping at wave 30, an Uncommon title dropping at wave 45, a Rare title dropping at wave 100, and an Epic title dropping at wave 300.


Each title uses one word to describe what map the waves were played on. Desert is used for Desert Temple, Winter is used for Winter Outpost, Pirate is used for Pirate Island, King is used for King's Castle, Demon is used for The Underworld, Samurai is used for Samurai Palace, and Canal is used for The Canals.

Gold Yield


With every loot drop, players also receive a gold reward. The amount received varies slightly around a fixed value. The gold amount is exactly the same as the rate for dungeons.


EXP Earnings


The table below lists the total experience gained after completing 15 waves (one loot cycle). This total is divided among 192 enemies and 3 bosses, since this is the amount that spawns in a single loot cycle.

Trivia



  
The addition of Wave Defence was decided by a poll in the vCaffy's Games discord, in which it gained the most votes. The other options were 'Raids' and 'PvP', the former eventually being added as Boss Raids, while the latter has likely transformed into Arena Champions.

  
It was formerly possible to create a Wave Defence party on Enchanted Forest, though it did not properly function. This has since been fixed.

  
The map lighting and color scheme of the coliseum is different between each playable map in Wave Defence.

  
Despite modifications made relating to Roblox China Policy (which resulted in the removal of skull hats from enemies in the Pirate Island dungeon), enemies in the Pirate Island Wave Defence still have them equipped.

  
In the Desert Temple Wave Defence, the Sand Giant will not attack using the fire lines.




Cosmetics


Cosmetics are items used to customize the player's loadout in Dungeon Quest. Cosmetics can be purchased for Robux (R$) through the in-game shop or earned for free by completing certain objectives, participating in Events, and even from Dungeons and Wave Defence.


There are four types of cosmetics: enchants, weapons, armors, and titles. Once earned or purchased, they are permanently accessible within the Cosmetics tab (located above the Inventory tab), and the player is able to equip one of each type at a time. Cosmetics only serve the purpose of vanity, overriding the appearance of any equipped gear. Cosmetics do not give a gameplay advantage. 


Contents


Enchants


For Cosmetic Shop enchants, please see this section. 


Enchants (formerly referred to as Weapon Enchants) are visual effects that can be applied over an equipped weapon. Enchants were added with the arrival of Winter Outpost, making them the oldest type of cosmetics in the game.


Each enchant provides one of three effect types; cover (covers the weapon), trail (trails behind the weapon), and both (covers AND trails the weapon).


Game Pass Enchants


There are currently no methods available to obtain free Enchants. There are 5 enchants that can be obtained with the purchase of a game pass instead of from the Cosmetic Shop.


Weapons


For weapons sold in the Cosmetic Shop, please see this section. 


Weapon cosmetics provide a visual override to the player's weapon if one is equipped. Weapon cosmetics were added in The Underworld update.


Objective Weapons


Currently, there is only one weapon that has a specific objective required in order to obtain it.


Armors


For armors sold in the Cosmetic Shop, please see this section. 


Armor cosmetics provide a visual override to the player's armor set and character. Armor cosmetics were introduced alongside Weapon cosmetics. There are multiple methods in which armors can be earned for free, which include earning Dungeon Cosmetics drops and participating in events.


Dungeon Cosmetics


Playing through Dungeons on Nightmare difficulty has a 0.48% chance (about 1 in 208) of yielding a Dungeon Cosmetic. In addition to an armor cosmetic themed after the dungeon it was dropped from, an Achiever title is also rewarded. These drops cannot be obtained in Wave Defence, and Hardcore mode does not affect their drop rate! 


Obtaining any three Dungeon Cosmetic drops will activate the Cyan runestone for the Excalibur Quest. Other cosmetics (such as Event/Shop items) do NOT count toward Excalibur Quest progression. In addition to this, Enchanted Forest, Northern Lands and Gilded Skies do NOT count toward the rune at this time, though this is likely an oversight.


Dungeon cosmetics are typically added in a separate update after the initial release of a dungeon.


Egg Island


 Egg Island was added on 2020-04-06 and was a participant in Roblox's Egg Hunt 2020 event. When originally introduced, it rewarded a Roblox avatar item if completed during the event's duration. There are 3 armor cosmetics and 1 weapon cosmetic that can still be obtained with a low (unconfirmed) chance after completing an Egg Island run on Nightmare difficulty.


Titles


Title cosmetics are rarity-colored text that appear on top of the player's name plate. Titles were introduced in the Wave Defence update. There are multiple methods in which titles can be earned for free, which include completing a certain number of waves, earning Dungeon Cosmetics drops, and after completing quests or event objectives.


Defender Titles


Playing through Wave Defence can allow the player to unlock special Defender titles. These titles can be earned from every map within the Wave Defence game mode. The title rarity increases with the amount of completed waves, with a Common title dropping at wave 30, an Uncommon title dropping at wave 45, a Rare title dropping at wave 100, and an Epic title dropping at wave 300.


Each title uses one word to describe what map the waves were played on. "Desert" is used for Desert Temple, "Winter" is used for Winter Outpost, "Pirate" is used for Pirate Island, "King" is used for King's Castle, "Demon" is used for The Underworld, "Samurai" is used for Samurai Palace, and "Canal" is used for The Canals.
