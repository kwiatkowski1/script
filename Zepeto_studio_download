ZEPETO


ZEPETO is a fun social app where you create a digital version of yourself and then go out and make friends.


The way ZEPETO works is simple: when you open the app, you'll be asked to upload a photo of yourself or take a selfie. From there, the app will detect the distinctive features of your face and create an avatar in your image. In just a few seconds, you'll have an adorable digital version of yourself, ready to socialize with the rest of the ZEPETO universe.


In the beginning, you won't have much: no clothes, no objects, etc. But as you participate in challenges and meet new people, you can earn points and use them to buy clothes and decorate your space. You can also level up, unlocking more objects, clothing, and activities. And everything you do in this universe is designed to be as social as possible.


ZEPETO is a fun way to socialize with your very own digital clone. Give it a try!

Ratings and Reviews


It‚Äôs social media not a game (please read if you‚Äôre wondering things about the game)


Ok what I want to say is, it is not (really) a game well, it has a thing on it called ‚Äòworld‚Äô it‚Äôs a little bit like Roblox bc there a many worlds/games on it. So i am going to explain what it is all about. It has a thing on it called ‚Äòfeed‚Äô witch is pretty much like tiktok but you can post little dances with your character and you can post you own videos and pictures it‚Äôs pretty cool. You can message people and send pictures and videos to the person that you‚Äôre messaging. And it has a thing called ‚Äòmatch‚Äô it‚Äôs a bit like tinder but don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs pretty safe in my opinion, but you‚Äôre probably like ‚Äúwth why would there be a tinder on a kids game?!‚Äù Well like I said it‚Äôs not really a game more like social media, and it‚Äôs not exactly geared towards little kids (more like 13 and up but any kid can have it in my opinion) and it‚Äôs optional you don‚Äôt have to have a profile on match oh and one more thing it‚Äôs not your own picture it‚Äôs your character. And there is this thing called ‚Äòcrew‚Äô it‚Äôs little groups that you can make or join other peoples crew. It‚Äôs sort of like all the social media‚Äôs mushed together (sort of lol) so there is SO much on the app that it would probably take ten thousand years to write it all down so really you‚Äôre just going to have to get it to discover it all. Anyways the app is great

Zems


I love ZEPETO it‚Äôs a lot of fun but however one problem that I have been faced with since I started using the app is that most of the pretty hairs and best outfits are zems (people usually follow others with cute avitars which are almost always people with lots of zems. while there are couple ways of getting zems it‚Äôs very rare to actually get them unless you buy premium which isn‚Äôt always fair for the kids that maybe don‚Äôt have the money or even their own money to spend on premium. So often I quit zepeto for months at a time because I just can‚Äôt get a cute avatar with out zems. Most people use surveys as a way of getting zems but my surveys never work and often it takes me hours to complete them only to earn ONE zem (currently they aren‚Äôt working they don‚Äôt even show up as an option for me anymore.) I know it‚Äôs hard to include easy ways for people to get zems because that‚Äôs how you earn your profit but I do have one suggestion and that is each day there is a number of adds you have to watch to get a zem like 10 or 20 to get one zem because I would happily watch ads to get zems and if you make the number of ads higher than it would still be somewhat hard to get them :). Also I understand that a new way of getting zems was just added style battling but it isn‚Äôt an option for me and it doesn‚Äôt say there is an update I have to do so that confuses me. I truly hope you read this because I spent a lot of time writing this so please take my words into consideration! üíé

Good


ZEPETOis good. I‚Äôm not crazy about it but I do enjoy it and the little things that you can do. It‚Äôs a friends based game. However, some suggestions would be letting other profiles, who like to create things, to get recognized. ZEPETO only likes to show case the videos with the most likes and doesn‚Äôt really allot people who wants to make videos and start of new to at least try to get show cases. You have to be a certain value in numbers in order for that to happen. However that is not the case when it comes to style which I highly enjoy. My other suggestion is for the follower list. I am a person who likes my follower list to be organized. So I roughly like to follow the same amount of people that is following me, however when someone unfollows, it takes ages to figure out who just to unfollow them back. It‚Äôs heavily time consuming. I know some people don‚Äôt care but I‚Äôm one of the few that does. It‚Äôd be nice if you had a system where it tells you if that person is following you back. Sure you can see on your followers who‚Äôs following you, but the moment someone decides to stop following you, that‚Äôs too many names to try to remember who‚Äôs not on the follower list. So a simple, ‚ÄúThis person follows you‚Äù either on their page or next to their name on your followers/ following list would be significantly helpful.
