CS:GO Console Commands List | Best, Useful and Fun


Most players use CS:GO commands to enhance their experience while playing the game. They offer you the power to change the game in ways that could assist you in dominating the enemy team. For some players, they’re the difference between winning and losing, while for others, they’re a key part of a strategy that the entire team uses. They’re not something you’ll come across unless you’re looking to up your game, which is probably why you’re reading this guide. Here we’ll take you through what commands are and provide a list of the best in the game.


How do you use Console Commands in CS GO?


Before you can use console commands in CS:GO, you’re going to need to enable the Developer Console. This is a simple process that we’ll walk you through below.



  
Open CS:GO, then launch the ‘Options‘ menu.

  
Click the ‘Game Settings‘ option.

  
Scroll down until you find the ‘Developer Console‘ option. Then change it to ‘Yes.’

  
Click the ‘Options‘ button again and then navigate to the ‘Keyboard/Mouse‘ settings.

  
Now search for ‘Toggle Console‘ and bind it to a key that CS:GO doesn’t currently use. By default, the Developer Console is bound to the Tilde (`) key.

  
Head back to the main screen and use the key that the Developer Console is bound to when you want to open it.




As you can see, once you’ve opened CS:GO, the process here is quite simple. First, you open the ‘Options’ menu, and then the ‘Game Settings’ menu. It’s here that you need to scroll around and find the ‘Developer Console’ option and toggle it to ‘Yes.’ With that done, you can open the Developer Console using the Tilde (`) key, which it is set to by default. However, if you’d like to bind the Developer Console to a specific key, then you can do so by searching for ‘Toggle Console’in the ‘Keyboard/Mouse’ menu within the ‘Options’ menu. Once you’ve chosen the key you want to bind it to, all that’s left to do is quit to the main menu and open the Developer Console.


Why can’t I open the console in CS GO?


If you’re unable to open the Developer Console using the method above, quit CS:GO and restart it. First, try the key that it’s set to by default, the Tilde (`) key. If that doesn’t work, search for it in the menus we outline above, and assign it to a new key. Now see if the new key you’ve set the Developer Console to will activate it. If not, there one more option you can try.


You might be able to activate the console key with a Config file. To do this, search for the following file called “Config.cfg” using the following filepath.


“Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg”


Once you’ve opened the file, the first thing you’ll see are lots of lines with the word ‘bind’ in. These are key binds. You need to search for ‘toggleconsole‘ within this file. The entry should look like the following.


If you can’t see it, copy and paste the above code into the file with the rest of the key binds.


Now you need to search for “con_enable” in the Config.cfg file. If it’s set to ‘0’ then set it to ‘1.’ If it’s already set to ‘1’ then leave it. It should look like the following for our purposes.


Now start CS:GO up again. When you press the bound key, in this case ‘F9,’ the Developer Console should open.


You can also load the console when the game starts automatically using the launch option ”-console”.


CS:GO Commands List


Now it’s time for the good stuff. This is a list of all the known CS:GO commands that you can use in the Developer Console. We’ve added a brief explanation of what each one does as well.
