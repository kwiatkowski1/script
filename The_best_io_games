Best Multiplayer .io Games#


If you’re a fan of the Battle Royale games, then you’ll get a kick out of Surviv.io.

Zombis.io#


Best Multiplayer .io Games#


In Zombis.io, you’re a scavenger by day and zombie hunter by night.

Another take on the Battle Royale genre, Bruh.io places you on a small island with a handful of other players.

Best Multiplayer .io Games#

Tetr.io#


Best Multiplayer .io Games#

Tetr.io more or less offers up the same experience. Clear as many blocks as fast as possible to beat out the other players in your game. The multiplayer options also includes the options to create your own custom games so you can battle it out with friends, or just hop into quick matches with random players. There’s also a ‘Solo’ mode where you can take your time, kick back and enjoy some old-school Tetris action without the stress the intense multiplayer action brings. It even comes with online leaderboards so you can grind your way up the ranks during quiet periods of work. Don’t worry, we won’t tell anyone!


Skribbl.io#


Best Multiplayer .io Games#


Skribbl.io has been around for a while, but it’s still one of the best multiplayer .io games you can play right now.

Best Multiplayer .io Games#

From FPS .io games to 3rd person shooters and more, vote up all the best .io shooters that are definitely worth your time, and vote down the titles you didn't enjoy.


Krunker.io


As one of the few .io games that take place in first-person, Krunker.io is a fast-paced multiplayer shooter where skill is the name of the game. As opponents can pop up anywhere (and at any time), you need to keep your head on a swivel and be ready for a fight at any moment. There isn't the safety net of having a top-down view like there is in third-person games, which means enemies can sneak up on you and strike at any moment. To start, all you need to do is select a class that fits your specific gaming style (there are nine to start) and from there you'll be ready to get into the arena.


Surviv.io


Surviv.io is a battle royale shooter where you will fight to be the last player standing. There is a red zone that slowly closes in on the players, and it's your mission to stay as far away as the zone in order to survive. As the zone closes, the play area shrinks which means that you will have to fight more players. To give yourself the best chance to survive, you need to make sure that you loot the best guns and armor that you can find.


Gats.io


Gats.io is a shooter that takes the genre in a more tactical direction. To start the game you will select a weapon, armor, and color. You will then fight other players to gain points, which are used to unlock upgrades and abilities. This game has an immense amount of replayability because there are over 20,000 unique load-outs. That means you can play the game as much as you want without things getting stale.


Zombsroyale.io


Zombsroyale.io is a battle royale game where the goal is to be the last player standing. You need to loot to to get gear and prepare for battle. Once you're looted you can get ready for fights. Get the jump on your opponents or fight them head on. No matter the approach you take the goal is the same, be the last man standing. Similar to Surviv.io (which is also a blast), the graphics and art style on this one are very unique, helping add to the replay factor.


Defly.io


Defly.io is a game for anyone who enjoys piloting helicopters. You control a chopper as you maneuver in and out of obstacles in an attempt to shoot your enemies out of the sky. The goal of the game is to take control of as much territory as possible. As you progress through the game, you will be able to upgrade your helicopter and buildings. You can get better defenses, or you can improve your guns.


Shooterz.io


Shooterz.io is a first-person shooter where you will be dropped in a foreign world and forced to survive on you own. The only way to escape is to fight your way out. As you progress throughout the game, you will complete missions, which in turn give you ability to upgrade your gear, which is a must. This will also help you climb the leaderboards so that you can show off to your friends.
