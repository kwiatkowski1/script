Spawning Items with Cheats


There are a lot of different items in Skyrim, in fact, there are over 8,000 items! The good news is that you can use console commands to spawn each and every one of them - this guide will show you how.


Firstly, you'll need to open to console. You can do this by pressing either of the following keys: ` (grave) or ~ (tilde). You can send commands by typing them into the text box (bottom of the console window) and hitting ENTER . If you're struggling to open the console, or want to learn more, check out our console help page.


The command we'll be using to spawn items is the AddItem command. The AddItem command's syntax is as follows:


player.AddItem [Item ID] [Amount]


All you need to do with the above command is as follows:



  
Replace [Item ID] with the item code of the item you want to spawn. You can find all 8,728 of these on our searchable item codes list.

  
Replace [Amount] with the amount of the specified item you wish to spawn. If you want to spawn 1 item, you'd enter 1, if you wanted to spawn 200, you'd enter 200, etc.




As an example, we'll use the wabbajack (a fun item usually received as a reward from The Mind of Madness quest). The wabbajack has an item ID of 0002AC6F - and we'll spawn just 1. If we factor the item code and amount into the AddItem console command, it'd look like this:


After executing the above command, you would receive a wabbajack! Here's our character with the spawned wabbajack:


That's all there is to this guide. If you want to read more console command tutorials, check out our blog. Find a list of all console commands on our command list.

How to use Skyrim item codes to give yourself every weapon and piece of armor


It's going to be years before we get to play The Elder Scrolls 6, but in the meantime there are still plenty of ways to improve your latest game of Skyrim by using Skyrim item codes.


In our Skyrim Console Commands post, we tell you how to use the in-game console to fly, walk through walls, become invulnerable, and lots of other fun cheats. We also tell you how to give yourself items using the in-game console, simply by typing player.additem and the correct Skyrim item code, followed by the number of how many of the item you want.


Of course, that only works if you know exactly what item numbers to use. That's why we've listed the Skyrim item codes below for all the weapons and armor in Skyrim (and yes, it works for Skyrim Special Edition as well). If you're interested in spawning NPCs, check out our list of Skyrim NPC Codes instead.


For other ways to change, improve, and break Skyrim, try our list of the best Skyrim Special Edition mods, best Skyrim mods (the original), mods for playing Skyrim as another character, and Skyrim graphics mods.


Daedric Artifacts


These are the items that are awarded by completing quest for the different Daedric princes of Skyrim. They include some very powerful items which have unique enchantments and effects.


000233E3 - Mace of Molag Bal


000D2846 - Masque of Clavicus Vile


00035066 - Skull of Corruption


Leveled Items


These items vary in power depending on what level you are when you first find them. I've included the codes for each different version, hopefully this will come in handy if you find an item at a low level but want to keep using it.
