BYNOWEB - Roblox Robux! - NO TAX COVERED


● Robux will be pending for 5 days until you can use it.


● After receiving the Robux, please click Order Received and feel free to give us a rating!

Robux will be credited to your account and you should be able to see it pending in the transaction page www.roblox.com/transactions 


Terms & Conditions No refund or cancellation after the gamepass is bought. 


PlayerAuctions makes it safe to buy from our members by securing your payment and guaranteeing delivery.


What can you sell on PlayerAuctions?


How will the seller deliver?


Option 1: In-game, Face to Face Delivery


Sellers will select this method of delivery if they intend to meet your character in-game with one of their own characters. Usually a seller will coordinate a time and location in-game to meet your character.



  
Be sure to conﬁrm the time to account for time zone differences

  
Confirm which Shard or Server the delivery is to take place in case your game world has more than one.

  
Never, under any circumstances, return gold, item, etc. to the delivery character if ever asked. In the event the seller asks you to, please take A screenshot and report this to PlayerAuctions Customer Support.




Option 2: In-game Mailbox delivery.


Some sellers will select the option to deliver gold or items directly to an in-game mailbox. This option is less popular for larger Games like WoW, but is still viable amongst other games. This option can be convenient for smaller orders because you do not need to coordinate time of delivery.


Why should I buy on PlayerAuctions?


Low Prices: Prices set by other players or PowerSellers on PlayerAuctions are significantly lower than the high markups you would find on expensive retail sites.


Guaranteed Security: PlayerAuctions is quite simply the most secure place to buy and sell MMO game assets. Through PlayerGuardian, you are 100% guaranteed full and as-described delivery, or your money back.


Reliable Delivery Speed: PlayerAuctions calculates each seller's average delivery speed from the seller's latest successfully completed deliveries, which gives you a clear idea of how fast the seller will deliver your order.


After I send payment, when will the seller deliver?


To see how quickly the seller may deliver your order, refer to the seller's delivery guarantee period, which is their promise to complete delivery within a certain timeframe after your payment is securely sent to PlayerAuctions and is successfully verified. Each seller sets their delivery guarantee period independent of PlayerAuctions. In the event that the seller is not able to complete the delivery within their guaranteed time, you may cancel the order without penalty for a hassle-free refund from PlayerAuctions.


What if the seller doesn’t deliver?


PlayerAuctions guarantees that the seller will deliver your order, or your money back. The overwhelming majority of transactions through our site occur successfully. As for the very exceptional cases, you can rest assured that they have been carefully considered by our systems and processes, and we are well prepared to handle them in the rare event that they do occur.
