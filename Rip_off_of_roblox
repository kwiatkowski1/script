5 worst video game rip-offs in Roblox


Roblox is a platform that had over 50 million games as of December 2022. Over the past several decades, the platform has offered entertaining original games like Bee Swarm Simulator, Tower Defense, and many more. Players can also opt for games inspired by other popular video games like Arsenal, inspired by Call of Duty, and Polyguns, inspired by PUBG.


Although inspired, the developers add a lot of fun and new elements to these games to help them stand out. However, not all of them make it to the top of the list. Here are 10 games that could have done so much more, but remained mere rip-offs of the original.


Roblox games that turned out to be rip-offs of the original


Listed below are the worst video game rip-offs in Roblox:


1) Hogwarts castle


This game, created by @pajasek99, was inspired by the famous video game Hogwarts Legacy, an RPG developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros.


Players in the original video game can experience life at the magical school of Hogwarts and explore the world. In Hogwarts castle, maps and spells are limited, with little to do.


2) CraftBlox


Craftblox is inspired by Minecraft, a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. In Minecraft, users can find and extract raw materials, make tools, and construct buildings and machinery in a blocky three-dimensional world with practically endless topography.


Achieving this kind of gameplay becomes difficult for any Roblox developer. Hence, CraftBlox feels like playing the oldest version of Minecraft. Additionally, the glitches make it even worse.


3) Fortnite Battle Royale Simulator


As the title suggests, this is a fan-made version of the original video game called Fortnite. It is a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing.


The Roblox game cannot fully simulate all aspects of Fortnite like the collection of weapons and equipment, the well-designed maps, and the various game modes that are a main attraction for a few players.


4) Grand Street


Inspired by the famous video game Grand Theft Auto, a series of action-adventure games, the game was created on February 14, 2021. While Grand Theft Auto is an open world where players can complete missions, Grand Street lacks a storyline.


The game has done a great job at almost capturing the same essence of the city through better graphics, but that's the only thing worth noticing. The choice of weapons, vehicles, and music does not come close to the original game.


5) NEED4SPEED


One can deduce from the name of this Roblox game that it is a copy of a super-popular video game called Need for Speed. It is a racing game franchise published by Electronic Arts and is currently being developed by Criterion Games.


Need for Speed is known for its graphics. With every series, they have touched levels of graphics that are jaw-dropping. However, NEED4SPEED hasn't been able to do so. The cars look basic, and racing maps are less exciting than the original game.

i played this once and they know they’re considered a roblox ripoff


It's a revival of old Roblox


A roblox revival is a game made out of a old Roblox version, this is not a revival.


I hope this game destroys roblox playerbase (sarcastic). Developers already did everything wrong with roblox and they destroyed the game many years ago. They even ban developers who have bad words in their game code (because chat censoring is broken and devs do their own chat filters). Almost all mini games are centered around forcing kids to buy upgrades for real money and then changing popular game modes to another where they need to do it again.


I agree. I used to play it ages ago, and when my sister got into it all she was doing was asking for Robux. I’d rather stick to playing Minecraft and AI dungeon, thanks.


Realises Mine coins are a thing


Roblox doesnt want people to have custom chat because it can allow curse words and work arounds im iffy about looking into the games code as theres nk record of people being banned from it


dude, do you actually play brick hill? they’re actually selfaware lol


I'm just looking for a knockoff Roblox to play since Roblox had a fucking breach that terminates your account when you play a game, this one is probably a good option before Roblox fixes this.
