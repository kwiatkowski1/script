Going Even Further


The Pokémon Go Team always has surprises in store when it comes to gameplay changes and new Pokémon to catch. As of December 2020, the team increased the level cap from 40 to 50! Before that, the maximum level that a trainer could have was 40, but thanks to Niantic’s effort, there are now more reasons to play the game! Since these changes are set to come by either the first quarter of 2021 or late December 2020, many people have already been prepping up for the day when the patch update comes. This is the perfect time to get a level 40 Pokémon account. Why, you ask? Well for starters, having a level 40 account right from the get-go means that you no longer need to grind and challenge other trainers just to get your Pokémon stronger. More often than not, accounts that are of that level already have strong Pokémon that can hold their ground; you can even become a Gym leader in your district with that kind of power! But then again, leveling is one of the most important and meaningful aspects of the game. Constantly looking for new challenges to try and achieving milestones are some key reasons people continue playing Pokémon Go in the first place. And since they decided to increase the level cap to 50, you can now continue your journey in collecting even more Pokémon as you strive to reach level 50.


Pokémon Go Lvl 40 Account


Because of the recent changes and updates that Niantic will be doing, many players see it as the best time to get to level 40 on their Pokémon Go account. Every action that you do in the game will grant you more XP than before thanks to the developers rebalancing the allocation of experience points to players. For example, you only got a measly 100XP if you managed to catch a Pokémon with an Excellent Throw. But thanks to the recent changes made in November 2020, you’ll now earn a whopping 1,000 XP for that throw. Basically, the amount of the XP you get from the game has now doubled. This will make it easier for players to level up and reach the level cap.


The Legacy 40 Challenge Quest


Another reason why you should get to level 40 before the year ends is because of the rewards they’ll be giving out to level 40 players before the start of 2021. According to Niantic, all players to reach level 40 will get exclusive rewards. This is on top of the ones you get from leveling up such as Lucky Eggs, Egg Incubators, Lure Models, Max Revives, and many more. You’ll also be awarded a “Legacy 40 Trainer” badge which is sort of like a badge of honor for those who were able to reach the current level cap before the huge update. This badge/award in turn will unlock the Legacy 40 Challenge Quest. The Legacy 40 Challenge Quest is a special research quest that commemorates the raising of the level cap of Pokémon Go to level 50. This challenge quest is only available for players who were able to reach level 40 on or before December 31. Upon completing this quest, you’ll get to earn rewards such as an exclusive Gyarados Hat that your trainer can wear.


To help you get to know the challenge better, here’s a rundown of what to expect:
