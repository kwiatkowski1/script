Fortnite


Fortnite is a first-person battle royale in which you try to outlast dozens of players on an island full of weapons, dangers, surprises, and a storm that will overtake everything around you. It has incredible graphics and a large amount of content updated every season and every chapter.


Fortnite includes two main game modes: the 'Battle Royale' mode and the 'Save the World' mode. In 'Battle Royale' mode, you jump from the battle bus to the island, where you'll fight against up to 100 players to be the last one standing. In this epic adventure, your only mission is to get the shield, weapons, and resources necessary to face attacks from your rivals. To achieve a masterful victory, you'll not only have to avoid enemy bullets but also have to escape from the storm, which devastates everything it touches. Flee to safety, find special locations, hire helpers, locate supply drops, and put out the flames to gain an extra advantage to help you reach the end of the game.


The 'Save the World' mode, on the other hand, is a cooperative version in which you join other players to defeat the hordes of zombies ravaging the island. In order to survive, you'll have to build defenses around your base, collect resources, find weapons, upgrade weapons, and help your teammates in frantic rounds that test your aim and survival skills. In this mode, you can discover new characters, level up your weapons, or unlock special abilities.


In both 'Battle Royale' mode and 'Save the World' mode, you'll have the option to search for individual games, either in pairs or in groups of four. In addition, you can choose to play with or without construction, in creative mode, or in any of the rooms created by the community.


This survival game is a very dynamic game that allows you to enjoy unique themed seasons with a battle pass that gives you free skins and special accessories. On the other hand, Fortnite holds special events on a regular basis where you can enjoy map changes, awesome challenges, and incredible encounters based on collaborations with great companies. In addition, Epic Games releases special content for every chapter and gives away free skins just for playing.


The game is available on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Android and allows cross-play between platforms, so you can invite all your friends without any limitations. Download Fortnite for free to experience a fun-filled, action-packed adventure.
