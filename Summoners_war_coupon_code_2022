Summoners War Anniversary Codes - 8 Year Anniversary Events


It's almost time for the final stretch of the Summoners War 8 Year Anniversary Event and its Friend Gifts and with those come more goodies from Com2uS! In this guide we will explain everything about the use, conditions and activation of the Summoners War anniversary codes. And don't hesitate to add your anniversary coupon in the comments.


What is an anniversary code in Summoners War?


An anniversary code in Summoners War is a little different from a gift or monthly code. This one is only available 5 times and is unique to your account. It will allow you to collect a maximum of 15 mystic scrolls for free.


Summoners who can use your coupon must meet one of the following conditions:



  
New accounts (created after 01/04/2022) ;

  
Returning summoners (must not have logged in between 01/04/2022 and the start of the event) ;

  
Summoners below level 49.




If you have a friend who has never tried Summoners War, now is the time to invite him üòâ


The Friendsgiving event lasts for 1.5 months. It ends on 31 May 2022 and rewardscan be collected until 1 June 2022.


To redeem your Summoners War birthday code from the Friend Gift Event, you need to go to the Event tab, then to the Gift with Friends event and finally to redeem your coupon.


How to use this special SW coupon?


If you are eligible and meet the conditions, on the event tab you will not get a coupon code but you will be able to use an anniversary code (only once).


Then, simply add the birthday code and validate by clicking on the "Validate" button. And that's it, you have received many rewards in your in-game mailbox.


And now it's your turn to send your anniversary code to your friends for the Friend Gift Event! üòâ


List of Summoners War anniversary codes - Friend Gift Event


If you meet one of the conditions, then you can use an anniversary code in Summoners War. I'm sharing some of them with you here but feel free to use the codes in comments as well or share your own.

So there you have it, you know all about the Summoners War anniversary codes that are present in this 8 year anniversary Friend Gift Event. If you're just starting out, check out our guide to getting started with Summoners War.


Why doesn't the 8th anniversary coupon code work?


As I said before, the 8th anniversary coupon code only works if you meet the conditions and if you activate it in the right place. Indeed, it can only be used on the event page. It will not work on the regular activation page even if you meet the requirements.

Summoners War Codes 2022 | Full List of Promo Codes (September 2022)


Updated September 13, 2022 | Summoners War (play free on PC) is the hugely popular turn-based RPG for mobile devices released by Com2Us in 2014. Also known as Summoners War: Sky Arena, it amassed a huge worldwide following thanks to its easy to use mechanics and compelling hero collecting aspect. With over 1000 creatures of different types to collect, there is a lot to see and do. Settling for a team of five units isn't an easy task given the huge selection at your disposal. If you're just starting out, it doesn't hurt if you have some Summoners War codes ready to give you a boost, so let's look at the latest Summoners War promo codes for 2022, and a few older keys as well that may still be working.


How to Redeem Summoners War Codes


Some of the following Summoners War Promo Codes are only available during a limited period, so it's normal to find that a few of them have expired. Other codes may have a longer lifespan and come in handy to boost your units in different regards. Among the rewards you'll find crystal, scrolls, energy, mana, and more.


To redeem your Summoners War promo code, you must do the following:



  
Run Summoners War.

  
On the main screen, tap on the Event icon that is located in the top right corner, right below your crystals.

  
Choose ‚ÄúGame guide‚Äù, scroll to the bottom, and tap on the ‚ÄúEnter your promo code here‚Äù banner.

  
Type the promo code exactly as it is shown and tap ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù.

  
Go to your gift box and tap ‚ÄúCollect‚Äù.




If everything went according to plan after redeeming a code, you should see a message saying ‚ÄúThe coupon code has been redeemed.‚Äù However, you may also get a few errors that may or may not be solved.


If you get a message saying that the promo code you entered does not exist, double-check the code and make sure that you are typing the correct letters and numbers. Beware of zeros and o's, as switching these will surely result in incorrect codes.


Playing with a guest account won't allow you to redeem codes, so log in with your existing Summoners War account or create one. There are several ways to do so, which include signing in with your Facebook or Google account, or creating a new Hive account under settings.


Some codes may have expired, so if you are absolutely sure that you have typed the correct code and it isn't being accepted, scratch that code and move on. In other situations the code cannot be used because of a network issue. Check your connection and if everything is fine, including the game's servers ‚Äì watch out for planned or unscheduled maintenance.


Summoners War Codes | Promo Codes Released in 2022 and Before


The list of Summoners Wars codes below includes many promo codes that were deemed valid. However, some of the codes are most likely not working by the time you read this, and for many different reasons: one code may have been offered in a limited event, so it may have expired by now; others may be limited by number of claiming players.


Nonetheless, there is surely something below that is going to give you a hand, and we'll keep adding new codes as they are released. Note that the monthly codes can only be used during the respective month. Check the known Android and iOS Summoners War codes for 2022 below:
