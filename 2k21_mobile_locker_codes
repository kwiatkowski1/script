Active NBA 2K21 Locker Codes: Tokens, players, and more


NBA 2K21 has a few interesting game modes up its sleeves – which is even more impressive when you consider it wears a vest – but most of them lead back to MyTeam. That’s NBA 2K21’s online team building mode, similar to FIFA or Madden’s Ultimate Team, and to get ahead, you’ll want locker codes.


These locker codes can grant Tokens, VC, or packs for MyTeam, and will change throughout the season with different MyTeam events or promotions. Sometimes, locker codes can even grant specific player cards to instantly give your team a shot in the arm. Because they refresh throughout the year, keep checking back here for new updates across the season. Some codes expire too, so be sure to claim them as quickly as you can.


Once you’ve redeemed the code, you’ll go to a chance mini game to determine which rewards you get. This is entirely down to RNG, but locker codes only have good prizes, so you can’t really lose.


what are locker codes in NBA 2k21?


These secret codes can be used to redeem special MyTeam rewards. They can only be claimed once per player, but there is no limit on how many codes any given player redeems across a season. If you grab enough of them, you’ll quickly see improvements to your MyTeam experience.
