About Battlefield 1 and BF1 Hacks


The long awaited Battlefield 1 game is here, and so, if you are a Battlefield fan, this is an opportune time to plunge into the world of chaos and experience what it’s like to play a world war one multiplayer shooter. Now, we all know that you are all excited as we are, but before you dive in, here is some information that you might want to know.


Battlefield 1 Release Dates


On October 13th the Battlefield 1 Origin Access trial went live, with 10 hours of gameplay available! The trial featured a limited number of game modes and maps, with more in the full game. On October 18th, people who preordered the Battlefield 1 Early Enlister Deluxe Edition can start playing 3 days before anyone else! The full game goes live on October 21st for everyone around the world. We were one of the first in the world to release our BF1 Cheat.


What about the Battlefield 1 Beta?


The BF1 open beta is available on the PlayStation Network for PS4 users under the Free Games section. For Xbox one users, you will get it on the Xbox store, and if you are an avid PC user, you will get it on Origin. PS4 users do not need to have a PlayStation Plus subscription to access the beta. However, Xbox one users need to have an Xbox Live Gold subscription in order to access. For PC players, you will certainly need to be on Origin as the game’s open beta is offered through the EA’s platform.


The beta is about 6GB, depending on the platform, but there is no pre-loading. You’ll have to wait until its done downloading to play. Right now no beta code is required, so don’t fall for the scam sites offering beta codes out there. You can also get our BF1 Hack Download so you can begin dominating in multiplayer.


What to Expect From Battlefield 1?


BF1 Multiplayer boasts multiple modes to keep multiplayer gaming fresh for hundreds of hours. More modes may be added as future DLC with the Premium membership available for the game. The following modes are the most well known and popular.


Conquest Mode 
This is a mode where two teams, up tot 64 players get to fight for control over certain objective markers. You can search online, particularly YouTube in regards to the gameplay to see more of what you can do inside this mode. 
Rush Mode 
In the rush, mode players are reduced to 24, but still at two teams. The teams take turns in both attack and defense. If you fail to protect your points, you will have to fall back and defend new ones.


What about the Weapons?


As expected, Battlefield 1 has an array of weapons that you would come across in the world war one. The list is quite extensive, so you won’t lack something that will impress you. From melee weapons to rifles, cavalry weapons, trip wire bombs, anti-tank guns and tankers, you certainly won’t lack something that matches your preferences. Oh, and I might want to add that you’ll ideally experience the latest addition to the saga, Horses. Yes, you will be able to ride on a horse and take out your enemies while at it. 
The game is a ton of fun, but as with any other beta, expect to experience a few hiccups here and there. Also, do keep in mind that you will not be able to carry over your beta progress into the full game which releases officially on October 21st this Fall.


Battlefield 1 CTE Now Available On PlayStation 4 And Xbox One; Download Sizes Revealed


Some time ago, DICE launched the Battlefield 1 Community Test Environment on PC, where players can contribute to the testing of future updates and additional content. Starting today, even PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players will be able to do so.


According to several online reports, the Battlefield 1 CTE is now available on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. To start downloading the CTE client, players have to access the More menu inside the game and then select CTE. According to other reports, the download is around 40 GB on both consoles.


Battlefield 1 CTE Now Available On PlayStation 4 And Xbox One; Download Sizes Revealed


Earlier this week, Amazon France started listing the Battlefield 1 Revolution Edition, which will apparently include the base game as well as all the content included in the Premium Pass and release later this month, on August 22nd. EA and DICE have yet to confirm this new edition of the game.


The next Battlefield 1 expansion, which will release during September, will be called In the Name of the Tsar. It will include four new maps, a new stationary weapon and much more.


Battlefield 1 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. We will keep you updated on the Revolution Edition as well as on all future content as soon as more comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.
