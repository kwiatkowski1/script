Subway Surfers is an endless runner that first hit our mobile devices in 2012. Since then, it’s been downloaded billions of times. The developer, SYBO Games, has been adding content ever since. The most recent update takes to the streets of Bali, where players can get their hands on the new Surfers, Mei and Maeko.


If you don’t know anything about Subway Surfers, then you are missing out on one of the best high score chasers to ever hit mobile devices. But, that doesn’t mean you have missed the chance entirely. At over eight years old, the franchise is still going strong and has recently been developed into an animated series.


With that being said, there is more in Subway Surfers then ever before, and our Subway Surfers guide sets out to give you the low down on all of it. There are missions, season hunts, and plenty of new characters to collect. As of right now, there are over 20 unique characters and 20 different boards. So, if you are looking for a breakdown of the Bali update, or just general tips and tricks, you’re in the right place.

Subway Surfers Score Boosters: How to get Score boosters


Score boosters are vital to achieving a competitive high score. This is because you can travel the same distance but only get a fraction of the points without a score multiplier. There are several ways to get score boosters, most of which involve watching an advert.


The quickest way is to start your go and press the star in the bottom left corner. This is where you can buy a boost for 3,000 coins or watch an advert for free. The easier way is to go to the store, click the ‘Free Stuff’ tab, and watch an advert there. Lastly, you can buy some score boosters in the ‘Boosts’ tab in the shop.


Subway Surfers Show: Where can I watch the animated tv show?


If you didn’t already know, there is an animated Subway Surfers TV show. You can watch episodes on Youtube or on the official Subway Surfers website.


Subway Surfers World tour list: Where next for subway surfers?


The developer of Subway Surfers like to keep people guessing where the next stop of the world tour is going to be. If you would like to follow the gossip you can check out the official Facebook page or Twitter account. If you would like a complete list of all the world tour locations, then check out the official Wiki.


SUBWAY SURFERS Download: How to get on ios and Android


You can download a copy of Subway Surfers for free from either the App Store or Google Play.


SUBWAY SURFERS Hack: why it’s a bad idea


Let me start off by saying that hacking any game is never a good idea. If you are caught hacking, then your account can be permanently banned. Just remember, if you unlock every item in the game using cheats, what have you got left to do?


Subway Surfers tips, tricks, and cheats


If you are playing Subway Surfers and want to know some gameplay or money-making tips, then check these out:



  
Upgrade: there’s an overwhelming amount of characters and hoverboards to collect in Subway Surfers, but don’t let it distract you. Sure, a swanky new hoverboard will help you get a higher score, but it won’t help collect coins. If you want to maximise your earnings, visit the shop, click on ‘Boosts’ and upgrade the jetpack and coin magnet. Both these items appear regularly and help you collect coins

  
Claim free stuff: every day there are free crates, keys, and more waiting for you to collect. Not all of them require adverts, but a fair majority do. If you are looking to make money fast, you can collect a lot more coins in a 30 second advert than you can by playing for 30 seconds

  
Save your keys: you can’t buy everything with coins in Subway Surfers. There are a number of characters and hoverboards that you can buy with keys. This means you should save up for something you want

  
Set your sights on something: flick through the hoverboards and characters and decide on the one you want. This will stop you from spending coins on characters that are cheap and boards that are bad. The quickest way to start collecting characters and boards is to save up

  
Be active: when you jump up in the air, you don’t have to wait for your character to hit the ground. You can swipe left or right to avoid an obstacle. If you need to roll under an upcoming object, then swipe downwards to hit the ground quicker

  
Grab the magnet: the magnet is the absolute best tool for coin collecting. Whenever you see the magnet, it is worth trying to grab it, even if you are setting a new high score. This is because you can always get multipliers and beat your high score later




That’s it for our Subway Surfers guide. Be sure to head over to our Subway Surfers codes for a bunch of cool freebies. Or, if you’re looking for a more competitive game to get ahead at, why not check out our Golf Clash guide?

Subway Surfers Cheats and Hacks for Unlimited Coins and Keys


Subway Surfers is one of the most addictive games that don’t need WiFi. Looking for Subway Surfers Cheats and hacks for unlimited coins and keys? Well, we’ll equip you with something better that would actually help. The cheats, the coin generators, they don’t really work. You should expect it to work only if you are willing to have a Subway Surfers modded APK file installed on your device (which is potentially dangerous). No matter what, we’ll also point you to some of the popular hacks (online generators) for unlimited coins and keys. If you’ve no problem trying them out, you can give them a go. Do note, that the Subways Surfers coins generators mentioned in the articles may be a threat to your privacy – if you don’t mind – feel free to check them out. In this article, we’ll be discussing the tips and tricks to hack your way to earn coins faster and level up quickly, which will be followed by the modded APK files and coin generators available across the Internet.

Subway Surfers Cheats and Hacks for Unlimited Coins


Subway Surfers is undoubtedly one of the best endless running games available for both Android and iOS. It offers a lot of gameplay hours. However, it isn’t easy for just anyone to unlock the characters quickly and earn the coins equivalently. With the hacks or modded APKs, you might be able to generate coins quickly and unlock the characters in an instant but playing the game wouldn’t seem to be as interesting or challenging as it felt while you first tried it.


Knowing the game, the items available, and the level-up method will help you score faster in Subway Surfers. So, we present you a list of tips that’ll help you proceed further in the game:



  
Utilize the Power-ups:There are several power-ups (or you can say – boosters) available in-game. If you run into them often (wherever possible) – it will help you multiply your score and give you the chance to earn a lot of coins in a single run to quickly unlock the characters or the hoverboards.

  
Run On The Trains:Avoid continuing running on the train tracks. Instead, use the trains to have an advantage over the obstacles. In other words, if you keep on running high, you will get rid of the burden to handle hundreds of obstacles on the ground. At least, that is perfectly the easiest way to continue running. Don’t worry, if you are not good at running high, keep practising – that will be eventually beneficial for further progress in the game.

  
Use the proper Hoverboard:People generally tend to unlock or purchase the hoverboard that looks cool. But, each of them offers a unique ability which will help you run for a longer time in the game for a grand score. So, make sure to check out the special abilities and then decide what’s best to choose for the best possible score. We would recommend targetting the following hoverboards: Daredevil, Bouncer, Lowrider, Hot Rod & Windglider. They do require a lot of coins to be unlocked, but it comes with a special ability, unlike other cool hoverboards. Each season of the game brings in new hoverboards, so make sure to check them out when you update the game.

  
Move Combinations: You’re Doing It Wrong For every game, there’s a specific movement combo which makes the navigation easier (or safer). Similarly, Subway Surfers houses some gesture combinations to follow to keep running longer. You do not have to wait for a movement to complete – you can always utilize them back to back for faster maneuvers. Recommended gesture combos: 1. Swipe up (Jump) + Swipe Right to quickly maneuver -> You do not have to wait for the jump to complete. You can move while jumping as well. 2. Swipe up (Jump) + Swipe Left -> Similar to the previous combo. 3. Swipe up (Jump) + Swipe down (Roll) -> It is a very common move combo which you can use to cancel the jump. 4. Swipe down (Roll) + Swipe up (Jump) -> You can use this combo to cancel the roll and initiate the jump.

  
Don’t Miss The Daily Challenges:The daily challenges might be interesting or could be boring. But, if you want to maximize your chances to earn more coins, you should not miss the daily challenges.

  
Complete The Goals:Repeatedly running for the same course will definitely earn you some coins. But, that won’t be enough. You need to complete the missions to multiply your rewards.

  
Collect ALL the coins:If you want to unlock characters and hoverboards very fast, you need to be perfect. Collect every coin you see! Yes, it is possible – but you need to practice for that. If you will aim for all the coins, it will help you in taking risks and learn critical gameplay thereby increasing your reflexes in-game.




Available Subway Surfer Mods (APKs)


To have unlimited coins, you need to uninstall the official Subway Surfers app. The modded APK files might contain malware, so beware before allowing the installation.


If you need the latest Subway Surfers Cairo mod, there’s a popular mod available in Zippyshare. You just need to download the APK file, and it’s done. With this APK file, you can play the modified version of the game with the ability to have unlimited coins and keys.


Do note that you will not be able to update the modded Subway Surfers game from the Play Store. Unless the creator of the mod hasn’t already rolled it out.


Online Coin Generators for Subway Surfers


While there are a lot of coin generators but a few of them (maybe 1 in a million) works. You need to connect your account by providing the details required by the generator tools. And, then they will try to generate coins or redeem them on your account.


Well, at least, that’s the theory. To experiment, I did try a generator years back with Clash of Clans, and it worked.


When you log in to the generator, you will have to complete certain surveys to get access further. Most of the time – it is utter nonsense. But, I do have some friends, who did mention of the tools to work previously.


So, if you are interested, you can try some of the generators by a simple query search on Google.


Conclusion


The best way to up your game would be by following the tips and tricks for Subway Surfers we mentioned. If that’s not your cup of tea. Instead, you just want to experience the latest hoverboards and characters; you may go ahead and install the mod APK files.


I wouldn’t recommend trying out the Subway Surfers unlimited coin generators online, but that’s still an option – if you want to try.
