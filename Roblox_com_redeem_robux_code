Why is My Code Not Working?


There are many different reasons why the code you’re using might not work. Still, usually, either the code has expired, or you’ve already used it without realizing it. Usually, the codes offered by the creators for each game have an expiration date and can only be used once per account.


If you frequently lose track of what codes you used, we recommend creating a Notepad or Word file and saving all the codes you used there. We also try to keep track of all the expired codes and separate them from active codes to serve you best. So if your code doesn’t work, chances are it’s either expired, or you’ve used it before.
