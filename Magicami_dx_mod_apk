Prologue


Do you believe in infinite possibilities? 
The world of “possibility”, the story of a magical girl and her daughter


“Use the magical girls to defeat the devil.” 
I can’t remember anything about the words of a mysterious girl named Kamisaman.


With many mysteries, there was no choice but to obey the words.


The days of magic and battle were suddenly visited by girls who were “normal girls”. 
I was confused by the “potentials” that I had never known before, but I was full of hope.


But one day, the hero knew. 
What defeat means. The “potential” of despair.


And he understood. 
That it was me who got them involved 
I can only save myself from there.


What do their eyes see and what do their hands choose?


Let’s start. 
A story of “potential” filled with despair and hope.


Battle system through Party Building


Guide 12 magical girls to defeat the enemy and prevent the world from collapsing!


Because it is a familiar turn-based command battle 
A simple and deep deck-making that you can enjoy!


If you combine the skills hidden in the dress, 
“First move victory,” “Kendan counterattack,” “Advantage closed” 
Anything!


In addition, the dress is a unique ability with equipment items!


Derived from many options 
“Strategy” = “possibility” is truly infinite! 
Enjoy your bargaining with your unique strategy!


MUSIC


The theme song and the song inserted in the game are in charge of the popular idol group “GANG PARADE” belonging to WACK led by producer Junnosuke Watanabe! 
In addition, the in-game BGM including the above songs are all produced by SCRAMBLES headed by Kenta Matsukuma!
