CJS CD Keys dispatches all of their digital products, including Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Codes, instantly via the Autokey system. The Autokey system is our in-house developed digital delivery system. Our system works similarly to instant email delivery, but you collect the codes via our website, which allows for a more secure environment than un-encrypted email delivery.
