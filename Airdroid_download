AirDroid


AirDroid brings your mobile notifications to your computer and, in addition, lets you send text messages, receive calls, respond to notifications, and even control the mobile device using your mouse and keyboard.


Pros


Notification forwarding: Once AirDroid is set up on your PC and your Android device, you can start forwarding your mobile notifications to your computer. The great thing is that these are actionable notifications, so you can perform some basic operations right then and there.


Wireless interactions: If you plan on having a long chat with a friend, you can use your PC and its keyboard to type; you may also pick up calls from your computer as well as send files back and forth. Not all features are available on unrooted devices, though.


Device mirroring: If you do happen to have a rooted device, you'll be able to view its screen as a window on your PC. From there you can control everything on the phone or tablet using your mouse and keyboard.


Cons


Root recommended: Some features, such as device mirroring, are only available on a few certified devices as well as all rooted ones. The software does function on stock handsets as well, but is infinitely more useful on rooted ones.


Data caps: The free tier of the service limits the size of the files you can send to and from the Android device to 30MB. There is also a 200MB data limit when your phone or tablet communicates with your computer while they're on different networks.


Bottom Line


If you own several Android devices and are tired of having to check them for missed notifications, you should definitely give AirDroid a go. This service will not only establish a centralized place for all of your Android notifications, it will also allow you to interact with your phone or tablet without switching devices.
