MONOPOLY Solitaire: Card Games Review


We have nothing but good to say about this game. Ya, theres adds but not annoying like some that take forever. They go quick. Give it a shot, its addicting.


We definitely enjoy playing the game – Monopoly and Solitaire have always been favorites. Our one complaint is the other players should not be able to steal property from you if you own the entire color group. Also, it would be nice if landing on Free Parking could net you a couple extra dollars as well, not just points.


This game is amazing we love it . Totally addicted.


We really enjoy this game, but theres some bug fixes needed. We turned off the music, but randomly get this almost jungle music that WONT go away! Have to restart app multiple times. Also, we have to be careful where Im at when we exit game (cant be on screen that says who is in what place), or it glitches when we open it next time and then have to restart multiple times.


We really like this game very simple you dont have to do a lot of thinking because it does it for you.


So we’ve been playing this game for a few months now (maybe close to a year), and we ran into a bit of a problem. We’ve gone up 3 levels and have not unlocked any new tokens or challengers. We know there are still tokens to unlock because we’ve gotten challengers for tokens we dont own yet. One of the tokens Im trying to unlock is the Millionaire Yacht. Also we just made it to LV 113 in case you that narrows down where we are in the group of players. We plan to go further so please get back to us.


There are way too many ads which takes the fun out of it! There needs to be an ads free option!


These ads are unbelievable Please change the way you do as its ridiculous.


We prefer to listen to our audiobooks while we play our games, or our own music. However, since the last update even if we select to turn off the music in the settings, it wont stop. Its very irritating. We even turned the music on and then quit the game and then opened it again to turn it off, but it was already turned off! Its stuck in the off position and yet its still playing!! Please fix whatever you broke in the latest update. ASAP. This review has nothing to do with the ads in the game.


Can we get a paid version thats ad free? We wish for that every time an ad pops up.


Its great on our iPhone but playing on our iPad is ridiculous. Its constantly crashing and Ill get a black screen. We cant play a single round without it crashing! So frustrating. If it werent for the fact that the mobile app works great we would only give it one star. Please fix the IPad version!!


We actually love this game but because of glitches in the quests we cant complete the quests. Some of these quests take multiple games to complete and when you finally complete them and dont get the credit it is extremely frustrating. We are quitting for a while to give them a chance to fix the issues if they do theyll get 5 stars from us. Im back after a few months and Im sorely disappointed in the fact that support would not give us a direct answer on whether or not the glitches are fixed. It takes a long time to complete som of these quests and we dont want to start if we cant complete them. We took our rating to two because of the lack of support Im so disappointed. Its really a fun game.


This game is fun. But we have never played a game that freezes up more than this one. After just about every ad, the game freezes. You have to go out and come back in. At first we thought it was our iPad and brought it to be checked. There was nothing wrong. No other apps do this. Not to mention if we have 8 or 9 dice toss we end up in jail or luxury tax or income. If not those its chance or community chest. Its soo annoying and makes you want to quit. We feel like its to make you watch more videos which is where they earn their money. People arent stupid! You say you want to fix this to others with the same complaints! Why not just fix it? Update:started counting and they are not always accurate on count when you move forward. And when they arent its always to chance, community chest, go to jail, luxury tax or income tax. And their count is not always accurate to get to these things. UpdateI would like to know how and why this game uses more data than Facebook. Please let us know how in the world this is possible??


One you figure out that there is a buying pattern this game is not challenging at all even at its hardest setting.


This is a great game when youre able to play it – but there are way too many ads that simply wont load! It forces you to close the app and completely reload the game. This would be fine if it only happened once in a while, but we deleted the app when it kept getting worse and more frequent! If they fix this issue we will consider downloading again.

UpdateI would like to know how and why this game uses more data than Facebook. Please let us know how in the world this is possible? And we have been countingexample: we counted 5 moves to get to Park Place and they moved us to the luxury tax which was 6 moves. Ridiculous. But we enjoy this game but we wish yall would stop playing games. And most of the solitaire games are almost impossible to solve. Why? Yall dont try to make money by selling items. It needs to be fixed! Its so annoying, especially when you really enjoy a game.


The app keeps crashing after playing ads. Which means we have to watch ANOTHER ad once we get back into the app. This has happened multiple times and we have only been playing for one day.


This game is really fun, but there are way too many ads & the ads double up! Stop the ads! We would pay for this game if there were no ads!


While playing our first game with a bot, we had $450 and the bot had $40. He already had boardwalk and then he landed on Park Place. He put it up for auction, and while we were trying to figure out how it worked the bot somehow purchased Park Place for $15. This happened twice and we still am not sure what to do when the auction pops up.


This game is fun. But the amount of ads is absurd. It seems every little thing we do in this game has to come with an ad. Not to mention every ad we have gotten with this game has been unskippable. Forcing us to close out of the game entirely. Just to load back in, play a few minutes. And get hit with another unskippable ad. The game does have a fun premise to it. But its sad to see app developers turn fun games into billboards that occasionally let you play games.


Numerous bugs from booting the app up and it being absolutely unusable because the graphics get all mashed together so we need to quit the app. Ads will get stuck and cant exit out if it so then again you need to quit the app. To landing a disproportionate amount of times on go to jail. If you like to be overly frustrated by an app this is the game for you.


We have tried to like this game but forget it. Too many freezes. We have had to delete the app and redownload to start game again. From other reviews it sounds like this has been ongoing. Surely it could have been fixed by now. Rules:why do we not collect $ when other players land on our property (other than utilities)? And why get pop ups when someone buys a utility? Who cares? The rewards for winning are the lamest- we dont want to change our tokens color- Again- who cares but maybe a pre teen girl. Why not give $ ? And who cares if you land in jail? The rolls still continue. And it would be more interesting if we kept our $ each new game instead of everyone starting over at same amount. The solitaire games are all too easy even on the hardest setting.


Fun if you like going to jail often.


At first it was just that the game would glitch every time we opened it; if we closed it and reopened then it would work fine. Then some of the ads started bleeding into the game; the sounds from the ads would continue to play simultaneously with the game music – very disconcerting!!


We really like this game except for the fact that when we have the music and sound settings turned off we still hear this awful music and sounds effects. We like to play this game listening to music but we will not play this game if we have to listen to horrible music and sounds when we have the options turned off. Fix this .


Waaaaayyy too many advertisements!! Its annoying.


Saw an ad for this and thought this would be awesome to play. Download crashed, we had to try 3 times before game ever started. Now it has dealt us cards without faces!! IMPOSSIBLE to play that way! Thanks anyway, guess we will stick to our other games!


This game is still freezing up with the ads. When reporting issue, they just say they want more information. Nothing is done to fix it. Froze up again multiple times and we just had to delete app. Do not waste your time.


If we select easy it should be easy. This game is rigged so you always lose. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.


This had the potential to be a 5++ star rated game except for the fact it is overloaded with ads which result in terminal blank screens if you choose not to download the game being promoted. Screens which necessitate exiting the game completely to escape and the same scenario repeats upon re-entering. Waste of time.


Im really enjoying this game. We like the side game of Monopoly too!! Its really fun. Havent had any glitches either.


We love this game but it has problems. So when we land on a property it wont let us buy it, the dice keep rolling and 75% of the time we always tolling the right number that lands us in jail. 2ND problems are the advertisements are a big pain in the but, if we wanted to play another game we would have already dont put it on this website.


We love this game. Im having so much fun!


We’ve been playing this game for awhile but Id like to see More players, and more challenging ideas.


We are still shocked how much more fun it is to play Solitaire, with a twist but then add a great game like Monopoly.. You have to try it! Its so fun to play and play against others! We highly recommend so far!


This game is quite addictive. It is easy to play, and can entertain you for hours.


Fun at first but even on hard not challenging.


We would give you 5 stars but you keep freezing and glitching.


We actually really love this game, but having to sit through an ad after literally every round is really maddening.


We got hooked on this game from the start. We dont mind ads in games, but when the ad wont close when we tap the X, thats a problem. Many, many times we have restarted this app, trying to get back into a game we started, only to get the very same ad for Infinity 8 ball that absolutely will not close, every single time. If nothing is done to address this, we will be deleting this game. Even a fun concept like this is not worth the headache.


This game is so fun. We play everyday and we really enjoy it but the ads really are aggravating. Please get rid of them.


Its fun but has been glitching a lot the past week. We have to close it out and restart it several times. Been doing this ever since the new update.


We like it, but 3* for not having landscape orientation. How absurd.


We like the premise of this game, but for us, it has a major drawback. First, let us say having played the game in real life gives us perspective of the probabilities on how this game is played. This game appears to be heavily skewed so that you spend a lot of time in either jail, or chance or community chest as opposed to landing on properties. It’s annoying at best. This is truly the first time we can say that an algorithm really bothers us. Finally, throw in all the ads you have to endure during the game, takes away the fun of the game. Sorry, we can’t rate this any higher than we have.


This game is fun and we like the concept of both monopoly and solitaire. It would be nice if there was a version that you could play live with other people not just computers. We seem to win every time- even when its in hard mode. Its just not much of a challenge because even when we set the goal to $15,000 Im still winning by a landslide. It would also be fun to have the option to play against friends. At this point its fun to play solitaire and kind of play monopoly but because we almost know Im going to win its not challenging at all.


Really fun game. Id be willing to pay to remove ads, but that is not an option with this game. Thinking about uninstalling soon. The amount of ads detracts from the game.
