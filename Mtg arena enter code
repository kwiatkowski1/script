All MTG Arena Codes – February 2023 [Complete List]


Designed by Richard Garfield and released in 1993, Magic: The Gathering pioneered the concept of the collectible card game (CCG, also known as trading card games or TCG).


We here at Retro Dodo are big fans of Magic: The Gathering (or MTG) – and have been playing it for more than 20 years!


Though there have been numerous ways to play MTG digitally over the last few decades – most notably with Magic: The Gathering Online, which launched way back in 2002, or the more limited Magic: The Gathering – Duel of the Planeswalkers titles – MTG Arena launched in 2019 and brought the full experience to both computers and mobiles, with iOS and Android apps both fully supported.


MTG Arena features numerous ways for players to unlock cards, level up and customise their experience – including the usage of MTG Arena codes.


What do MTG Arena codes unlock?


MTG Arena Codes can unlock in-game Booster Packs, give you a boost to your experience or provide cosmetics with which you can visually customise your game, without affecting the gameplay for yourself or your opponent.


Where can I find MTG Arena codes?


Many MTG Arena codes can be found in physical packs of Magic: The Gathering cards – such as many Theme Decks and Starter Kits (the latter of which will give you two codes, to be used by two different players on MTG Arena!).


Codes found in packs and other physical products will be unique, single use codes that can only be redeemed once.


Do be warned that neither Commander nor Challenger decks have codes inside the box, however.


Also, be aware that some MTG Arena codes expire, making them viable for only a limited amount of time.


How to redeem MTG Arena codes?


Despite being available on mobile, MTG Arena will only allow you to redeem codes on the PC version of the game – or via a Wizards of the Coast account page.


Thankfully, it’s very easy to redeem MTG Arena codes, despite the fact that you can’t do this on the Android and iOS versions.


If you’re looking to redeem your codes on the PC version of MTG Arena, simply open the game on PC and click the Store tab (found at the top of the page). A small text box in the top right corner which says ‘Redeem Code’ will be there – just copy your code into this text box, press enter and you’re done!


If you’d rather just do this via your Wizards of the Coast account page, that’s not difficult either. Just log in with your MTG Arena account (you can use the following link); on the right side of your account dashboard, there’s a ‘Redeem a code’ field. Type or paste the code into that field and click redeem – and you’re done!


What MTG Arena codes are currently available to use?


Leaving aside expired or time-limited codes, all current codes for MTG Arena can be found below, separated into categories and listed in alphabetical order.


Booster Packs MTG Arena Codes


The following codes will give MTG Arena players a significant number of free cards to add to their collection.

When are new MTG Arena codes added?


Note that a code is usually added when a new MTG set is released; this will usually grant players three free MTG Arena booster packs.


Not every set receives this treatment, however – as we’ll now explain.


Are there other ways to get free Booster Packs without MTG Arena codes?


Yes – neither the Phyrexia: All Will Be One or Alchemy: The Brothers’ War sets received corresponding booster pack codes.


However, if you log into your Wizards of the Coast account, you’ll find 3 Phyrexia: All Will Be One packs as a gift in your inbox, as well as 6 booster packs from the Alchemy: The Brothers’ War set.


When will more codes be added to the MTG Arena codes above?


We’ll update this page whenever a new set receives its corresponding code – and if time limited codes are released, we’ll add those in with the necessary time period and caveats too, so watch this space!
