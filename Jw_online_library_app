Ratings and Reviews


Awesome, but one thing that I want to suggest


I love JW Library, for the meetings, bible reading, studying, and videos. It‚Äôs certainly a blessing from Jehovah. One thing that I think you could add, and I think you maybe have in the past on certain devices, but Apple and Samsung don‚Äôt have it. So, this is mostly about music videos, but could be used for other things as well: A shuffle button. The original music that you provide is amazing, but it would be nice if we could tap that shuffle button and do everyday things. Like for example, when driving, especially to meetings and service, it would be really nice to just be able to click shuffle and have random songs play for as long as you want. I don‚Äôt know if this is done in other places, but here in the middle of Wisconsin, some congregations public witness in Flea Markets, and we usually have an open tent with a table with literature on it. We also play Become Jehovah‚Äôs Friend videos on the table to attract people to the carts. A shuffle button would be pretty handy in that situation. Sure, you can just click on a video and then the videos following it will play, but especially with the songs, it‚Äôd be nice to have a way to shuffle them. So, just a suggestion, and there are others ways of doing this on different devices; I don‚Äôt know if you even look at the reviews, but if you do, there are people out in Wisconsin that might find this useful.
 


I love the JW Library app.


Thank you so much brothers for all your hard work in making this most amazing app in the world available to people everywhere! I use it every day all day long and it has been such a blessing and it has helped my spirituality immeasurably! I wanted to let you know that I have been experiencing an issue for sometime now with updating publications. I tap on the circle to download the update and it says installation failed. If I close the app, it will go ahead and show that it is updated so there is a workaround but hopefully you‚Äôll be able to come up with a solution for this. It isn‚Äôt just on my iPhone and iPad but it‚Äôs on my wife‚Äôs iPhone and iPad as well. This is a particularly big issue with updating the Research Guide for 2019. I tried updating it in the publications and it failed. I also tried updating it in the Study Bible using the link that is on the side in the Gems but that fails also. It won‚Äôt update like the other publications do even if I close and reopen the app. I really hope you‚Äôre able to find a resolution for this because the study notes are incredible tool to use in preparation for meetings as well as doing personal research. Again I appreciate all of your hard work and effort and it just gets better all the time. So thank you my brothers!
 


so great!!


hi i am 9 years old and i love all the celeb and Sofia videos i watch them all they so good üòÉ they make me smile! Me my brothers and sisters are having trouble in sharing üòû i dont like it and its so hard to stop it. Can you please make a video where celeb and sofia find a really pretty flower and they both want it because its special so they start fighting over it and celeb says ‚Äúno sofia its mine give it back. ‚Äù sofia said to celeb: ‚Äúno its mine i found it first!‚Äù They‚Äôre mom comes and says‚Äù whats going on?‚Äù Celeb is sad and says ‚Äúsofia took my pretty flower to give to you!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo celeb took MY flower to give to you!!‚Äù Their dad comes and says ‚Äúguys, guys, why are you fighting over a flower saying it is both yours? jehovah created all things including this beautiful flower for us to enjoy, not fight over!‚Äù celeb and sofia both look at each other and go to talk. when they are done talking they both hold the flower together and smile and hand it up to they‚Äôre mom and they say ‚Äúhere mom we both have a flower to give to you!‚Äù mom says ‚Äúaww it is so pretty thank you guys!‚Äù dad says ‚Äúgood job kids!‚Äù So you could add to that if you want and maybe you could connect a scripture to that for people tp read! I bet there is a good scripture to connect to this. ok i will wait for it and look forward to it üòâ
