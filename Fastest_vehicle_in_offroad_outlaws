Offroad Outlaws – Best Off-Road Vehicles to Use & Customize


In 2017, Battle Creek Games (developer of Pro Series Drag Racing) unleashed Offroad Outlaws off-road simulation game for mobile. For those who are new to the game, Offroad Outlaws is unlike any freemium off-road racing simulation during its time. This is because this highly immersive game encourages players to build and design their own off-road rig. The game also comes with multiplayer options, a collection of open-world maps, and a realistic tuning system.


The best part about this game is that it has continued to evolve ever since its inception more than four years ago. From a humble freemium game, Offroad Outlaws has now evolved into an expansive title packed with tons of modern features like photo mode, realistic physics, and more. 


 
However, as much as we want to dissect the various features embedded within its core structure; that is a topic reserved for another day. Today, we are going to take a quick overview of some of the greatest off-road vehicles that you can use in the game. So, fasten your seatbelt and get ready to find out more about Offroad Outlaws’ best vehicles to date.


Best Vehicles in Offroad Outlaws


Before anything else, do take note that no vehicles in the game are licensed. This means that the design of each vehicle is just copies or inspired by the real thing. This is why despite the resemblance of real-world vehicles you will never see a brand listed in the game. Not to mention that some of the vehicles in the game are obtainable through membership or premium purchase only.


For that reason, all the vehicles on this list are available for purchase using the game’s basic currency. Although the vehicles in the game are clones, some of the parts like the Mickey Thompson tires, RIPP Superchargers, Yukon Gear & Axle, and Titan Fuel Tanks, on the other hand, are licensed. With that out of the way, check out some of our rigs below.


Jeep Wrangler


For the truck category, one of the most sturdy, if not the most reliable off-road vehicle to customize, is the Jeep Wrangler clone. The sheer size of this off-road vehicle not to mention the plethora of customization items makes it one of the best off-road vehicles in the game. You can purchase this vehicle for 25,000 or 125 gold. Customizing this vehicle will cost you from 50 to 100k but it’s going to be worth it. 


1979 Ford Bronco


Another type of vehicle that is fun to tune up and customize in Offroad Outlaws is the 1979 Ford Bronco clone. One of the builds that we like to do with this classic beast is by installing Monster suspension, monster tires, and maxing out every component of the truck. This build can climb through any terrain including rivers and mud. You can purchase the 1979 Ford Bronco Clone for 25k. 


Hummer H1


How can you make a beast more beastly? Easy, just slap some random customization items into it, like what we did with the Hummer H1. Some may look at this overrated vehicle as an eyesore on the highway but seeing it traverse off the road is another thing. If there is one thing for sure, the Hummer H1 is definitely built for the wild and not for urban settings. Just max out every element of this beast and have fun driving it on the game’s open-world map. You can get the Hummer H1 clone for 50k. 


Quads, Boats & Trailers


When it comes to Quads, all of the selections featured in the game are as fun and powerful as they look. You just need to be creative in customizing and tuning up these vehicles. The game does not have a huge selection of Quads so choosing the right one will not be hard. The same goes for the boats and trailer selection.


Bikes & Crawlers


Similar to the Quads, the bike and crawler selection in this simulation is not that many. Nevertheless, the availability of these vehicles is a much-welcomed addition or alternative when you get tired of riding your 4x4s. The price of bikes in the game ranges from 15k to 35k. Crawlers on the other hand come with a 65k t0 100k price tag.


Offroad Outlaws on PC


Offroad Outlaws is a great simulation that comes complete with in-depth elements and features. The wide collection of vehicles and the various terrains makes this title a must-have for off-road enthusiasts. With that said, what better way to experience this game than through your PC? Simply click on this link, follow the instructions, and enjoy endless hours of tuning, customization, and off-road gameplay on your PC.
