Connect with your inner artist and with other members of the Las Vegas community through cross-generational conversation and creativity. (Courtesy Sprat by Ronda Churchill)


The Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art is entering a new partnership with Sprat, a nonprofit organization that brings people from different generations together with the transformative power of art.


Together we are creating an eight-week series of dynamic art workshops with participants drawn from UNLV’s student body and the senior communities of Las Vegas. They will join with local artists to practice various artistic disciplines, including painting, drawing, performance, and sculpture. Each individual artist will select a unique artwork from the Barrick’s permanent collection to use as inspiration for the group’s activities.


By uniting artists and the community with the resources of the Museum, the Barrick and Sprat hope to reinvigorate the essential bonds that hold us together, promoting a more humane and imaginative vision of our future through a diverse collaboration of multigenerational insights.


This partnership is supported in part by the Nevada Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts.


To find out more about the workshops, visit our Sprat x Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art Eventbrite page 


This is a free series, all supplies provided.


*By registering you are committing to attending at least 4 sessions.*

Sprat 
Established in 2014, Sprat brings people together to form connections through the transformative power of creative arts. Sprat believes in community, creativity, and vulnerability as the path to authentically express ourselves and our deepest stories. Since our inception, the company has always been drawn to the meaning of the word Sprat, which means a small herring, aka a tiny fish. Sprats swim together, work together and thrive off of each other and the well-being of their community as a form of survival. Sprat recognizes our elders as the most important participants in designing the future of our world, acting as the bridge between generations by delivering one-of-a-kind learning experiences. Through its science-backed art curriculum, Sprat’s goal is to bring together connection, community, and creative projects with the belief that working together in the arts can truly heal us.

The Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art 
The Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art believes everyone deserves access to art that challenges our understanding of the present and inspires us to create a future that holds space for us all. Located on the campus of one of the most racially diverse universities in the United States, we strive to create a nourishing environment for those who continue to be neglected by contemporary art museums, including BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ groups. As the only art museum in the city of Las Vegas, we commit ourselves to leveling barriers that limit access to the arts, especially for first-time visitors. To facilitate access for low-income guests we provide free entry to all our exhibitions, workshops, lectures, and community activities. Our collection of artworks offers an opportunity for researchers and scholars to develop a more extensive knowledge of contemporary art in Southern Nevada. The Barrick Museum is part of the College of Fine Arts at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV).


All of the museum’s galleries are accessible to wheelchair users and other visitors who cannot use stairs. Services such as sign language interpretation can be arranged. Please contact the museum to discuss your needs: barrick.museum@unlv.edu, 702-895-3381.
