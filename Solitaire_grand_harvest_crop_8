Tips for Solitaire Grand Harvest?


I'm on level 47 and don't have enough coins to keep going. I tried looking up tutorials on Youtube, but the draws are randomized. I don't think I can get to level 147 in 11 days if the levels keep getting harder. Anyone have any advice? Sorry if this has already been posted, I didn't see any threads talking about this.


This game is quite terrible. but as for tips, basically save up and buy the power ups for every single match. I preferred the one that eats all the cards that are showing (windmill). This is far cheaper than using Wildcards during the stage or needing extra cards if your deck runs out.


Yes, this costs you per match, but you'll usually be about 2/3 star the level, which then gives you a larger harvest basket when you finish the crop. That's really the key - getting those 48 stars for the crop harvest. This then gives you tons more free power ups as well as a gold boost to - you guessed it, buy more power ups to climb higher.


DO NOT PLAY THE BONUS/CHALLENGE STAGES. They are a waste of gold. You can double your output for a given crop by completing it, however the gains are very minimal. For instance, I think the first crop gives you like 20 gold when you harvest every hour. It then would double to 40. Big whoop! Not worth the 30k+ gold it takes to finish the challenge stages.


When I did it, I checked the harvest hourly for extra gold, saved up to about 20k-30k gold, bought the power ups with gold, finished ~8 stages, and repeated daily. On days I could finish a crop with the harvest basket, I could go another 8-12 stages or so. After 5 or 6 days, you get to the required stages completed for the offer. Good luck!


FWIW, the game becomes easier once you see how it works, but I would not play this again for 2000 SB. I would not recommend my friends to play this for 2000 SB. I might do it for 4000, though. Overall, it was just a frustrating time of RNG that relied on checking your phone hourly for income to use on powerups to finish a stage. It didn't feel like I was really playing anything except the waiting game.
