SmartNews


Stay up-to-date on the most important current events


Latest version


SmartNews has compiled dozens of the most important newspapers in the world in one application to offer a great selection of relevant and important daily news. NBC News, TechCrunch, The Huffington Post, Bleacher Report, Quartz, The Verge, Vox.com, Reuters, AP, and Perez Hilton are just some of the sources that this app uses to keep you informed.


This app will be a huge help when it comes to getting full access to all the news. For starters, before you start reading, you can select preferred sections which will appear on the main screen, avoiding sports if they don’t interest you, for example, or creating your own custom list.


Once you've chosen the topics that interest you, you can navigate between them as though it were a newspaper. If a particular article interests you and you want to expand the content, simply click on it, and then you can read it more comfortably via a website-like format (including pictures) or in a block of simple text.


The best part of SmartNews is its integration of social channels, since in addition to analyzing more than ten million newspapers to offer you the best selection, it features the ability to share every link on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Plus, WhatsApp, or via email, and all with a single button that links to each tool. You can also interact with other users through comments on each article.
