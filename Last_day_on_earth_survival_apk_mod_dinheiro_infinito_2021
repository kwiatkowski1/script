Last Day on Earth: Survival


Last Day on Earth: Survival - an adventure game that tells the story of the hero's survival after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed almost the entire population of the Earth, turning it into a crowd of walking dead. Only a few, having immunity to the virus, were able to survive and continue to exist. One of these lucky ones turned out to be the main character, for which he will play.


In the game you need to do typical actions for games of this genre. The character needs to build and modernize the shelter, which will help in the fight against the raids of zombies. The remaining survivors, too, should beware, as not all of them are friendly towards other people. In an open game world, you can find all the items and materials that will be needed in the construction. We also need to look for food, hunting and gathering.


The game has a good graphics and convenient control with a view from above. Atmospheric soundtrack keeps in suspense.
