RoPro - Enhance Your Roblox Experience Reviews


Best roblox extension ever. One suggestion though, it would be cool if RoPro could display the total hours played on your Roblox profile. 10/10 roblox extension!

This extension is just flat-out amazing!


This extension is just flat-out amazing, I saved time with this extension. You can find low ping servers, and even better! Profile themes! It also supports Btroblox and Roblox+. 100% recommend if you are a Roblox trader or just want new styles for Roblox. Also if you want to join the discord server use the code Ropro
See you on the Ropro.io community side! :D

Really great for low ping servers


Without it i wouldn't be able to play on low ping which the feature that i bought Pro Tier for (i know Standard Tier also has the sort by best connection but Pro Tier has 2 features that i like which are the Live Visits and Live Active players i think) Also it has the Avatar sandbox which is such a great feature to test things on your avatar!

Ropro not letting me find servers.


I got on Roblox one day,And I went to find a server with one person, so it's like a private server etc,And then it didn't let me find a server,it only let me refresh,I don't know if it's an update,but I don't like it.

yh :,)


Literally this is one of the best extensions I have downloaded for Roblox. It helps me with trading too, so I'm not confused with certain things. It also helps me reach people way easier with the discord user option!!

Best option!


Itâ€™s extremely good made but a bit expensive, itâ€™s the best thing that Iâ€™ve ever tried.
It has never failed and the ONE thing that everyone needs to get the ultimate Roblox experience.

Best Roblox Extension


I have to say this has to be one of the best extensions for Roblox. I would give 5 starts but sometimes the Avatar Sandbox is kinda buggy but otherwise this is a 10/10 extension.


Date of experience : March 30, 2022


review


this is a good extension, but the pro features lasts 
3-2days and you're stuck with the gray ropro logo aka the "free" subscription, other then some pros and cons, its good

This automatically patches the RoPro extension for you, allowing you to have pro_tier for free.


My RoPro subscription has expired as of 29/01/2023. This means that the servers will appear as "Unknown Region". If you have a subscription and would like to help everyone else out, please message me on Discord or create an issue so we can talk further.


Chrome, Brave (and possibly other browsers) have a feature that checks the hash of the extension. This means that it will flag as corrupted. Therefore, you will have to download the extension, patch it with a custom path and use developer mode to load an unpacked extension.


This currently does not support Firefox but it easily can be done manually. To disable hash check, download the nightly build and then it will be an optional flag.



  
Go to where your extension is installed, usually at %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles followed by your profile name (the most recently modified folder) and finally into extensions .

  
From there, find the RoPro file - for me it is named .xpi .

  
Now, change the .xpi extension to .zip and extract.

  
Next, apply the custom path patch to it.

  
Rezip the file and change the extension back to .xpi .

  
Make sure to override the old extension.




this should get around Chrome/Brave's "corrupted" message



  
Download Chrome extension source viewer in the Chrome Store

  
Go to RoPro

  
Open the extension we downloaded, and press "Download as zip"

  
Extract the downloaded extension

  
Use the custom patcher to patch the downloaded extension

  
Enable developer mode on your browser

  
For example, go to opera://extensions (or wherever you can view your extensions)

  
Press "Load unpacked" (or similar) and select the patched extension folder

  
Done!

You should see something like Inspect views background page under RoPro

  
Press on the underlined background page

  
The developer console for the extensions should open, go to the console tab
