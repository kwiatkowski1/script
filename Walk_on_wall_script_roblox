[Request] Walk on Walls script


I don't know if script requests are allowed here or if I'm breaking rules, I joined a few days ago. I'm looking for a gravity controller type script like this 
loadstring(game:HttpGet(" https://pastebin.com/raw/geUZHr7B "))() 
--press z to toggle it 
It's the best walk on walls script I could find. Is there any script like this that doesn't invert your camera? If I'm breaking rules, please have mercy.


Hey shitass wanna see me upvoting


I'm gonna go test that in a bit, by the way does it work on krnl? (don't hate me for not paying for synapse I've heard that so many times, I have my reasons and don't harass me)


Ok, I just tested it. It isn't as good but its very similar to my other wall walking script that isn't as good. By the way, here's the script that's really familiar:


Also I already have that script, it's from Dark Eccentric, video link.


That one isn't smooth, and I just don't like it


No disrespect I don’t want to sound like I’m hating, but why not just use a fly script. Cheat engine can control gravity but on the Microsoft store


its fine, I don't use cheat engine though (I use krnl and prefer it over cheat engine.) I just wanna walk on walls, I have a fly script but I think that walking on walls is cool
