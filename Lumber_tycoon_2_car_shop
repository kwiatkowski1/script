Features and Anomalies


Rough floorplan of Wood R Us



  
Wood Dropoff 

  
Located on the store's side, the Wood Dropoff is the only feature that exchanges Wood for Money besides trading.





  
Accessing the store roof: The ladder to the top of the store. 

  
There is a ladder hidden above the large Blueprints sign above the Blueprints section of the store.

  
If one is able to jump on top of the large sign or use other items to access it, players may climb the small ladder through a hole, and access the top of the store.





  
Rukiryaxe Posters 

  
The store contains two Rukiryaxe Posters, one located behind the wood drop off, and the other on the back side of the large roof sign. These posters hint players of the Rukiryaxe quest.





  
Bulletin Board

  
The Bulletin Board is a very famous feature, which is located within the store. It consists of papers and posters, which gives hints and teasers for players, as well as a few jokes and laughs.





  
Pink Spheres

  
The Pink Spheres are, hence the name, pink-colored spheres that is a filler part for the model instance, located within the roof of the store.





  
Wood R Us Pit

  
The Wood R Us Pit was a strange and mysterious hole that appeared sometime during early to mid-December, 2016. During January, 2016, when the "Nothing is random" poster appeared on the Bulletin Board, it was removed and was patched up by grass. However, below the previous hole, is an unused Snowglow Bin that remains up to the game's current status.





  
Retirement Stand

  
The Retirement Stand is a platform from which items that were sold before in Wood R Us resides, located below the Wood Dropoff.
