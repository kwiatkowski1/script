A social network surrounded by controversies

However, it has been immersed in plenty of controversies as of late. A rumor has started to spread over the Internet saying that ZEPETO tracked and monitored its users through the camera and microphone of their mobile devices (very similar to Talking Tom Cat's eyes). It all stems from several Twitter accounts that alerted that if you held your phone up to your ear whilst the application was running, you could hear a strange sound, sometimes static noise and sometimes a beep sound.
