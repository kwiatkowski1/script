Hack WATCH 12+


Apple Watch support! Ever wanted to be a hacker? Your adventure continues as you're asked to save the world again. Hack WATCH is our FIFTH game (3rd chronologically), but anyone can play! Hack WATCH uses complex memory puzzles to simulate hacking into enemy systems. As you unravel the details of your secret mission, you will learn about your opponents and how deadly they can be.


Accessing new systems or discovering key information will increase your skill level. As you achieve your goals, you will move closer and closer to the final achievement: over 100 levels! And Hack WATCH will remember what level you're on so you can switch between your iPhone and Apple Watch.


It's time for another Hack RUN!


Stuck on a level? Just view the 'information' screen on your iPhone to help you along.

Gameplayer iPhone


Can you imagine being able to patch all your iPhone or iPad games? Well, that's what Gameplayer for iOS is all about, a tool that allows us to introduce all sorts of cheats through patches.


The application to mod iPhone games


This tool works similarly to GameGuardian for Android. If you've never heard of it before, it's an application editor that allows us to scan and modify the values in a game's memory. Well, this is the same but applied to iOS. In other words, if you're playing Subway Surfers for instance and you want to increase your number of coins to an exaggerated limit, you just have to search for the value and replace it with the number of your choice.


These are the main features of this app:



  
Scans game values and extracts them to replace them.

  
Compatible with the majority of iOS versions.

  
Bypass anti-cheat protections.

  
Simple editing functions.




Requirements and additional information:



  
Minimum operating system requirements: iOS 9.0.

  
Compatible with: 

  
iPhone

  
iPad

  
iPod touch




With a degree in History, and later, in Documentation, I have over a decade of experience testing and writing about apps: reviews, guides, articles, news, tricks, and more. They have been countless, especially on Android, an operating system.
