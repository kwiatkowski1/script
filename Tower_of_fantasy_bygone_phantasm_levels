Bygone Phantasm


Bygone Phantasm is an adventure mode in Tower of Fantasy. In Bygone Phantasm, players fight through Ex Scientia Levels, and are able to obtain clearance rewards for each level milestone cleared. These rewards can only be obtained once. These levels reset every Monday at 05:10 PST which will randomly change the enemies encountered on each level.


Weapon Enhancement will be automatically upgraded to the maximum of its current level in the Bygone Phantasm. The damage of 2-4 random weapons will be enhanced by 1-3 stars every day at 05:10 PST.



  
Level 1-100: SR1 x1 + SSR x 1

  
Level 101-300: SSR x2

  
Level 301-500: SSR x3

  
Level 500 and above: SSR x4




When the weapons reach the maximum star level, a further star level upgrade is converted into Damage Boost. Each star level increases the damage by 5%.


Players may also jump to a higher level in the Bygone Phantasm if the player's current CS is above the recommended value. Players can only jump 11 levels each time, however they cannot directly jump to Level 600.


Additionally, players can earn Ranking Rewards based on their performance in the Bygone Phantasm. Ranking Rewards will be sent according to the Wanderers' rankings in their groups, and then the Wanderers are regrouped according to their previous week's rankings. Furthermore, their current levels will be reset to the closest level of a multiple of 10, rounded down. For example, Level 97 will be reset to Level 90; Level 197 will be reset to Level 190.


Rankings


Trial of Hykros and Battlefield of Elites use the floor and clear time of Bygone Phantasm as their ranking criteria. Battlefield of Champions is ranked by the current week's total score of Sequential Phantasm + the current floor x 10 of Bygone Phantasm, and is ranked according to this total result.


Rankings will be calculated every day at 05:10 PST.



  
Trial of Hykros: Characters that haven't logged in the previous week will be automatically assigned to Trial of Hykros this week. If they log in during the current week, they'll be assigned back to the Battlefield of Elites.

  
Battlefield of Elites: Every Monday at the top 10 Wanderers in the Battlefield of Elites will advance into the Battlefield of Champions.

  
Battlefield of Champions: Every Monday at 05:10, bottom 10 Wanderers in the Battlefield of Champions will be demoted to Battlefield of Elites.

Boundless Realm


Once the Wanderer has reached Ex Scientia Level 500 in Bygone Phantasm, the Wanderer will gain access to a new series of Bygone Stages, known as Boundless Realms. These stages are considered high-difficulty levels and consist of powerful enemies and bosses during the season.


Rewards

 Boundless Realm Level Rewards  3 Spacetime Crystal Fragments ×20  6 Fortress Tactics Eyepiece Shard x20  9 Fortress Microreactor Shard x20  12 Fortress Exoskeleton Shard x20  15 Spacetime Crystal Fragments ×20  18 Fortress Tactics Eyepiece Shard x20  21 Fortress Microreactor Shard x20  24 Fortress Exoskeleton Shard x20  27 Spacetime Crystal Fragments ×20  30 Fortress Tactics Eyepiece Shard x20  33 Fortress Microreactor Shard x20  36 Fortress Exoskeleton Shard x20  39 Spacetime Crystal Fragments ×20  42 Fortress Tactics Eyepiece Shard x20  45 Fortress Microreactor Shard x20  48 Fortress Exoskeleton Shard x20  

Sequential Phantasm


Sequential Phantasm is a sub-gamemode of Bygone Phantasm, where Wanderers can participate in different stages with different modifiers to earn Sequential Phantasm points. Unlike Bygone Phantasm, these modifiers will negatively impact the Wanderer's combat abilities in a significant manner, from immunity to certain element types to combat debuffs for the Wanderer. As a result, Wanderers should read the stage weekly details of each stage and prepare accordingly.


Sequential Phantasm Leaderboard



  
Ranking is based on the score of each Wanderer in Sequential Phantasm.

  
In the case of equal scores, timing will be used as a tie-breaker for the ranking.

  
The leaderboard only displays information of the top 100 Wanderers.

  
You can view the information of other Wanderers on the leaderboard.

  
Every Monday from 05:00 to 05:10, the leaderboard will stop. At 05:05, the top 10 will receive a title reward for a limited time of one week. (See more information in the Title interface.)




Rewards


The rewards receivable will be determined based on the Wanderer's ranking, and will reset at the start of every week.

 Bygone Phantasm Game Mode 


One of the most complex modes that the game has to offer is definitely the Bygone Phantasm ga mode. It has extensive combat experience, and the progression system is very challenging.


If you are not enjoying the multiplayer game modes like Dimensional Trials and Joint Operations, you can try out Bygone Phantasm, as you can play the mo e solo. Do check out our comparison on Tower Of Fantasy vs. Genshin Impact to see which game is better for you to play.


The reason why many people prefer Bygone Phantasm over multiplayer game modes is due to the fact that it has more challenging levels and better rewards. On the other hand, multiplayer mods have daily and weekly tasks that don’t compensate much and require a lot of effort.


Moreover, Bygone Phantasm is a floor-based combat mode, so the levels are more challenging and interesting as we go higher.


According to in-game information, Bygone Phantasm is a consciousness infiltration space that is invented by Hykros in Tower Of Fantasy. When you enter Bygone Phantasm, you can extract the consciousness of an Executor.


Doing so will allow you to enter the consciousness of your evil enemies. The enemies include the terrifying Ravagers and evil Hyenas.


Your goal is to lower and break their aggressive consciousness. Doing so require es a lot of training beforehand and high-level weapons and gear. If you’re not rained enough, you cannot survive the highly damaging attacks of Ravagers and Hyenas.


 How To Unlock The Bygone Phantasm Mode

Bygone Phantasm mode in Tower Of Fantasy


Also, we have curated a guide on how to get the Jetpack and how to use it. You can take o the Bygone Phantasm challenge as many times as you want. But keep in mi d that you can only beat the mode if you have high-end gear and weapons.


In case you have the weapons that are shown in the weapon bonuses for Bygone Phantasm, you can switch to those weapons so that you can inflict increased damage on the enemies. Additionally, you will get a 30% or a 60% increase in damage from weapons depending upon the weapon you are maneuvering.


Unlocking the mode is not that hard. You just need to reach level 26, and the Bygone Phantasm game mode will be unlocked automatically. You can then access it from the Adventu e Menu.


Interacting with the orange node


Also, keep in mind to have good equipment before you join the mode as you will be facing some terrifying enemies here.


Once you have unlocked the Bygone Phantasm Mode, you will be directed to a screen that will show your current Grouping. It will include the lapsed players from that Trial Of Hykros.


Also, if there are any consistent players that appear in the Battlefield Of The Elite, they will also be present there.


Entering The Bygone Phantasm mode


The top 10 ranked players of the Battlefield Of The Elite will progress further to the Battlefield Of Champions. However, it will happen only on Mondays at 5:10 EST. The Battlefield Of Champions is a place where the challenges are extremely hard, and the rewards are also great.


 How To Clear The Bygone Phantasm Mode 


Since Bygone Phantasm is a floor-based trial combat mode, clearing it will require a lot of your time and effort. However, it has many perks to it as well and the effectiveness of any weapon you use during the Bygone Phantasm mode will be increased by 1 or 3 stars.


Furthermore, if you are using any Weapon Enhancements for your gear, they will also be increased.


 Rooms And Enemies 


When you have unlocked the Bygone Phantasm Mode, you will first enter a room upon selecting it. The battle arena will have an orange no the right in the middle. You will need to activate it to start t e Bygone Phantasm mode.


After you have successfully activated the orange node, a group of lower-level enemies will spawn in front of you.


Floor one has seven enemies, and all of them are on level 18. To clear all the enemies that spawn in the first level, you will have two minutes and 30 seconds. After you have successfully completed t e level you will advance to the next one.


 Floors 


There are 600 floors or levels available in the Bygone Phantasm game mode in Tower Of Fantasy. It is no doubt that it will take a lot of time for you to go through all of these. However, you do not have to clear all t e stages in one go.


As you advance through the levels, the enemies will become harder and harder.


Generally, the difficulty of enemies will increase by one level, and you will also have to face unique and stronger enemy types as you move up the floors. However, to complete each floor you wil require two minutes and 30 seconds, so the timeframe itself will not change.


This gets harder and harder as the more challenging enemies on the higher floors will require a lot of time for you to take down.


 Failing A Level Or Floor 


You might not be able to clear several floors on your first try. So it is important to have the best wea ons and armor in the Tower Of Fantasy as the enemies on the higher floors cannot be defeated using the starting weapons in the game.


You can choose to exit or go to the next level.


In case you fail the tower by running out of time, or simply by dying, you can start the floor again and try as many times as you like.


However, if you decide to return, You will be able to see your stats and performance in the Bygone Phantasm mode. You can see your rank, and you can also claim the items and rewards the game mode offers depending upon the number of floors you managed to successfully clear.


Also, your recently cleared floor will be reset to any of the nearest multiples of 10, and it depends upon the performance and the rank you get by the end of the week.


Weapons


For weapons, we recommend using higher DPS weapons as they will deal a good amount of damage to enemies. Furthermore, weapons with large AOE wil also help you take down enemies in a shorter time span.


 Team Compositions For Bygone Phantasm
