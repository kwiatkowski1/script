5 Best Roblox Games Like Welcome to Bloxburg


There’s certainly no shortage of life simulation games on Roblox, which makes sense, given how the bulk of its universe is centered around community building and roleplaying. Even with its multitude of genres that spread far and wide across the platform, simulation games make up the most popular tiers, and it’s mostly thanks to games like Welcome to Bloxburg that its reputation continues to exist.


Of course, there’s far more to Roblox than Welcome to Bloxburg. And to be fair, one good game does not technically speak for the who kingdom that is Roblox, either. Question is, which games like Welcome to Bloxburg contribute to the ground-breaking success of the franchise? Well, if a home away from home in Bloxburg is your ideal cup of tea, then you’re sure to get a kick out of these five, too.


5. Brookhaven RP


If you live and breathe roleplay and fancy the idea of building a new home outside of Bloxburg, then perhaps Brookhaven RP will suit your needs? After all, it shares a similar amount of sandbox and roleplaying elements, and it certainly brings the entertainment factor to an equal altitude. And factually, it’s one of the most popular life simulation games on Roblox, with a sturdy 250,000 concurrent players logging on to develop their worlds on a daily basis.


Brookhaven RP provides an entire community hub for you to explore and turn into your own virtual haven. From the local church to the market, the playground to the hospital — the town of Brookhaven opens it doors to you and a population of like-minded builders and roleplay enthusiasts. And although the inclusion of Robux may be a little off-putting, its simple and incredibly addictive gameplay elements definitely make up for it, if only slightly.


4. The Plaza


Looking for a new hangout spot that revolves around the center of the Roblox world? Perhaps it’s time to set up shop in The Plaza, a life simulation RPG by Pixeltail Games. Here, you’ll find a communal area that boasts a network of markets, apartments, and completely customizable megaplexes. It’s sandbox 101, and it is perhaps one of the trendiest games on the Roblox storefront right now.


The Plaza doesn’t just offer you the opportunity to mope around a bustling complex with your Roblox buddies, though. In fact, you can even claim your own set of keys to an apartment that’s fully tailored to your own design. In The Plaza, it’s your world, and you can share it with whomever you choose to onboard into your social circle. Therefore, if you’re after a sweet blend of life simulation, sandbox, and casual meet-and-greet, then The Plaza is definitely a viable option you should entertain.


3. Urbis


If you happened to feel the post-city blues following the 2004 release of EA’s The Urbz, then you’ll be pleased to know that some of its heart and soul was eventually carried over to Urbis, an entirely new life simulation game with all the same vigor. Although a few miles apart from Maxis’ best-selling phenomenon, the Roblox counterpart certainly did a tidy job at filling its eerily vacant shoes. And today, well, it certainly stacks higher than most life simulation games that have tried to break the same barrier.


Urbis is exactly what is says on the tin: a life simulation game that takes you, the suburban dweller, on a brand new journey into an action-packed neighborhood, a place in which jobs become mini-games, and open spaces become sandpits for you to develop and morph into whatever your creativity desires. With thousands of neighboring communities all on a similar track to make their worlds flourish, you too can join the network and make something from scratch. Urbis awaits, and it’s handing you the tools to craft without limits.


2. Sunset City


It isn’t very often you spot a Roblox game that follows all the same controversial lines as Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto, but Sunset City definitely tries. Although not entirely on the same wavelength in terms of mindless violence and profanity, it does gift players with a whole lot of familiar elements, few of which you wouldn’t traditionally associate with a standard life simulation game. Needless to say, though, Sunset City is definitely worth checking out, if only to see what all the fuss is about.


It’s simple, really: Sunset City is overrun with mobs, crime rings, and corrupt organizations. And guess what — it’s you who will indulge in its underworld as you forge a life among the twisted folk that call Sunset City home. Grand Theft Auto it most certainly is not, but a watered-down Roblox clone, on the other hand? Absolutely.


1. Tiny Town


Tiny Town is hands down one of the best life simulation games on Roblox, period. Thanks to its all-in-one interface, the game not only acts as a sandbox for you to experiment with, but a fully functioning community packed full of careers, customizable homes, vehicles, and thriving hot spots for the locals to meet up in. In short, it’s everything you could want and more from a traditional Roblox experience, but with perhaps double the content.


Welcome to Bloxburg is one thing, but if you’re hell-bent on establishing your name as one of the biggest on the Roblox roster, then you’re definitely going to want to consider the idea of setting up a time share in Tiny Town. Customization? Check. A hearty community full of world-loving avatars? Check. A fully comprehensive life simulation game that’s also free and worthy of your time? Check, check, and check.

Roblox has a strong attraction on both artists and gamers because to its unique array of skills.
