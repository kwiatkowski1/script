Reviews from users


A Google user: I like this game. I was disappointed to see that the voyage challenges ended after the first set, but I came to this game late so I guess the developers left it to die or thrive on it's own. I find the sculpting annoying because even when I have enough belief to sculpt the land the way I want it to go, it reverts back over and over again. But I love the rest of the game. And I like that the second world is even more challenging than the first. Great game!


A Google user: It is a beautiful game and the graphics are pretty. Little harder to mold the landscapes on a phone screen but it's doable. The game is quite simple and relaxing. You can do as much or as little as you want. The ads were not intrusive and I had no trouble getting stickers or gems without doing the voyages. The only problem is that I couldn't continue the game after I finished the ark. The app wouldn't move past the loading screen no matter how long I waited so I uninstalled it.


A Google user: Awesome game. I love the concept and the graphics are gorgeous. Very fun to play in full moments at work, but also fun for longer bursts! My only issue is that the controls for sculpting the land can be frustrating - I find it hard to actually select what layer I am trying to sculpt and end up wasting a lot of 'blessings' (the in game currency of sorts) on accidental sculpting or sculpting the wrong layer. Despite that, very lovely game and I am seriously enjoying it!


A Google user: Downloaded this game again to give it another chance. First time, it was frustrating and boring. Now, it's still the same. The boat is useless cause you can't earn all 3 stars after the 3rd island. When moving layers, the wrong ones move instead, waste of belief. Played game for a good 30 mins, then go back in a couple mins later to check and all my progress in my previous play is gone. Had to do the darn thing again. And tabs just keeps popping up like I don't know what they are/do.


A Google user: It's a great concept, very nice graphics but the control is clumsy and frustrating. In order to move the map around you have to use 2 fingers to drag. If you forget and try to use one finger to move the map, like every other similar game, you end up changing things and losing valuable resources. It was the frustration of the terrible interface that finally made me uninstall this game.


A Google user: Was having fun with this game. Great design, sound, and everything like that. HOWEVER, today, it keeps telling me that I'm disconnected when trying to start the game. I know that I'm connected, but clicking "join" does nothing. I just get the same message over and over. Also, you gotta watch an ad just to see your cards. Super annoying, especially when I didn't have to when I gust started playing


A Google user: First off, removing and adding land is very inaccurate! I wasted a lot of beliefe trying to change the land and it simply does not work well. Next, I have no clue why I started to lose happiness, with no guidence on how to change it. To progress you need stickers on your cards to activate them. I did well in the first Islands, but as expected, because of the land shaping problem, Its impossible to clear the second stage with 3 stars. It becomes a pay to play at this point to progress.
