Fortnite V-Bucks Gift Cards – Where to redeem and buy them including Walmart, Target and GameStop


In a blog post on the official Epic Games Fortnite website, it was announced that Fortnite V Bucks gift cards would be coming to retailers in the near future. The blog post stated that the V-Bucks would be available in select US retailers over the next few weeks.


On the new section of the Fortnite website dedicated for the V Bucks gift cards, there is no mention of them being available anywhere other than the US, but we could see them in other countries in the near future.

The blog post and site fail to mention exactly which US retailers will be selling the gift cards, but we already know that they’ll be available at Walmart, Target, and GameStop players have been posting images of them in-store.

Redeem Code


Once you’ve purchased a card or been lucky to receive one, the code will be on the back of the card. In order to redeem the code on the back, you’ll need to head to the redeem V Bucks card section of the Epic Games website that you’ll find over here.


You’ll need to click the “get started” button, select the yes or no on the “do you already play Fortnite” question which will prompt you to select what platform you play on and then require you to login. Once you’ve done that, you need to enter your code to redeem the V Bucks gift card.


The V Bucks gift card blog post also mentions the popular Fortnite Merry Mint Pickaxe. It’s available when purchasing officially licensed Fortnite products for free whilst stock lasts. It’s available in the US, United Kingdom, France, and Germany.
