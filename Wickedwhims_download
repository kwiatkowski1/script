WickedWhims features dozens of useful commands that are available for all users. To see the full list of commands, open the Commands Console in the game by pressing the CTRL+SHIFT+C keys on your keyboard.


You can scroll up and down the list of commands with the scroll wheel on your mouse. Every command is placed under a category that is related to its purpose.


If you want to learn about commands syntax:



  
Certain commands have arguments, they are values that you might need to provide to use the command. These values are always placed after the command, separated by a space.

  
Usage of angle brackets (‘’) indicates that an argument in the command is required. You cannot use that command without inputting that argument.

  
Usage of square brackets (‘[‘, ‘]’) indicates that an argument in the command is optional. You can ignore it if you don’t find it necessary to input it.

  
When a command asks for a Sim first name and last name, but that Sim has a space in their name, use the underscore (‘_’) character in the places of the spaces.
