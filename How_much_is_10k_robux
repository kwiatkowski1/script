is 10k robux a lot?


i recovered my old account from like 2009 a few months ago and i had 13k robux. i have spent 3k since then and am down to 10k. i was just wondering if that is considered a lot in modern day roblox.


Yeah thats a lot dude, they made everything based on robux ;(, tickets dont matter anymore


Depends who you ask and in what context. For regular shopping yeah, for limiteds it won't get you too far but its enough for many things. For DevEx its 35$. For me its a lot since I have 4 total.


For a high tier developer its pocket money.


That's roughly 100 dollars worth.


Robux should be valued at devex rates rather than purchase rates (as that's where they can be officially transferred for money) which makes it worth more like $35


In the limited scene 10k robux isn't considered a whole lot anymore. If you are going to use it for things like game passes and clothes/packages then in that sense it's quite a bit.


Actually in sellable value ~$40


Take that and multiply it by 0.0035. Your devex equivalent would be $35. I'd say that's a lot for an old account.


Depends on how you see robux, as a player, some people may think it's a lot some people like me, just don't give fuck! [Is swearing against the rules]


If you ask me 10k is lots but in trading no. 35 bucks devex?


Are you dumb? This is 40 bucks

Marketplace fee


The marketplace fee is a percentage of revenue that is taken out of all items that are sold for Robux on Roblox.


This fee helps support the Roblox economy by keeping the supply of Robux consistent, reducing inflation. The fee for normal members was ~90%, as opposed to ~30% for Roblox Premium users. As for the fee for developer products and passes, the fee used to be ~90%, as opposed to ~30% for Roblox Premium users, however on April 2, 2020, an announcement was made on the Developer Forum by coefficients saying that the fee for developer products and passes has been decreased to ~30% for all users.

History


The marketplace fee has always been a percentage taken out of the revenue received from any sale. It was implemented when users first began to create and sell their own Clothing and was introduced at an amount of 10%. Later, when the Limited items system was implemented, the fee for Clothing remained at 10%, while the fee for Limited items was established as 25%.


On July 25, 2012, Roblox increased the marketplace fee for all items to a 30% fee. They did this in an attempt to regulate the Robux that came into the economy. When Pass/Developer Product selling became available to users without Builders Club, the Marketplace Fee was established as 90% for those users.


On April 2, 2020, former Roblox administrator coefficients made an announcement on the Developer Forum announcing that the fee for developer products and passes has been decreased to ~30% for all users. [1] The fee used to be ~90% for non-Premium users and ~30% for Premium users. Based on replies to the announcement, the change was well liked and heavily supported in the developer community.


This fee also applied to sales made in Tickets, prior to their removal in 2016.


Useful Formulas


When you sell an item, many times you may want to know exactly how much profit you are going to make. The marketplace fee seems to get in the way of this; unless you use a little bit of basic algebra to figure out the amount you have to sell the item for to make a certain profit.


The formula for how much profit you make from a sale is described below. So if let's say you were to sell an item for 50 Robux, each sale will earn you 70% of the sales price, which is 35 Robux.


profit = 0.7 * price profit = 0.7 * 50 profit = 35


 
Therefore, selling at the lowest possible sales price, which is 5 Robux, will get you 4 Robux per sale.


profit = 0.7 * 5 profit = 3.5 profit = 4


 
Now, let's say you want to make a profit of 100 Robux. What is the minimum amount you have to sell the item for? To find this out, plug 100 in as your intended profit and use algebra to figure out the value you should sell it for by diving both sides by 0.7 so you can get the price variable, and rounding up the result to remove the decimal places.


100 = 0.7 * price (100)/0.7 = (0.7 * price)/0.7 142.8571 = profit profit = 143


This means that if you want to make a profit of 100 Robux, you have to sell the shirt for 143 Robux.


Criticism


The marketplace fee for those without a Roblox Premium membership was seen as heavily excessive by some users in comparison to what those who did have a membership paid (avatar shop items only: 90% for regular users as opposed to 30% for Roblox Premium users).
