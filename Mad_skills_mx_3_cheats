Pop Some Wheelies


This is both an enjoyable and beneficial idea in Mad Skills Motocross 3. Considering that it's a racing game, the goal is to have some speed. One way to gain ground? Pop a wheelie. You'll see carrying out a wheelie will help you select up speed if you've ever played a game like Grand Theft Auto V and rode on a motorbike.


The very same uses here with Mad Skills Motocross 3. It's just a little tricky to get it refined, however it contributes to the enjoyable and challenge. And after that, once you do have it mastered, you'll most likely feel a sense of fulfillment. Holding the arrow the makes you do a backflip, will enable you to carry out a wheelie when you're on the ground.


Just take care, as drawing back a bit excessive will trigger you to crash backwards. Just attempt and practice it and do it at the correct times and you'll be gravy. Once it ends up being much easier for you to do, you'll be having a wheelie great time throughout races (yes, that was essential).


Upgrade Your Bike


This type of goes without stating, however it's a great concept to upgrade your bike as you progress. You can enhance whatever on your bike. From handlebars to the engine and whatever else consisting of the wheels, tires, and suspension. Each of these parts of your bike adds to various qualities. The qualities are speed, acceleration, managing, traction, and weight. There is also Total Power which is basically your bike's total ranking, identifying how great it actually is. When hovering over each part, you'll see which associates the part enhances. You'll see that upgrading your engine enhances your traction, speed, and acceleration. You can go ahead and acquire a new bike if you'd like once you get enough credits.


The Basics


While we can consider Mad Skills Motocross 3 to be a casual game, it has much more depth than what you may think. No, it doesn't come with real-life bikes nor does it come with real-life motocross racers, but each Career Mode race against AI opponents, starting with the tour of Germany, features your user character racing against four other riders on a fixed course we say fixed to differentiate them from the "procedurally generated" courses where every whoop or other obstacle is random. Each of your bikes are rated based on their power, as shown on the qualifying screen before each race, but you don't need to worry about any qualifying times — the race starts with all five riders at the starting grid, and your opponents won't start moving until you hit the green button on the left side of the screen. That pertains to the gas pedal on your bike, with the red button on that side allowing you to hit the brakes if needed.


On the right side, you'll see an up arrow and a down arrow; you will use these buttons to shift the balance on the tires of your bike. Tapping on the up arrow lets you do front flips in the air, while tapping on the down arrow lets you do back flips hitting these buttons while your bike is on the ground/on a surface simply allows you to steady it, or to perform a wheelie. For each of these races, you will be given three tasks, or challenges, to complete, and that will serve as the basis of your reward the more challenges you complete, the more coins and Reputation you will earn. Coins are the game's common currency and can be used to upgrade your bike, while Reputation allows you to increase your player level. You have the option to double your reward at the end of a race by watching an ad video.


And speaking of options, these tasks are, for the most part, optional in order to earn a reward, you will need to finish in the top three, or a podium finish in other words. Failing to finish in the top three will nullify whatever rewards you may have earned by completing the challenges, so it's important you aim for this each time you race in Career Mode.There's no need to worry, however, if you fail to make the top three, as you can always replay the race until you complete all of the challenges, and you can still win coins and get more Reputation in repeated replays, as long as you're on the podium. There's also a button on the right side, located above the up and down arrows, that allows you to instantly restart the race. This is very helpful in the event that you crash, which may happen quite a lot, especially during your first few hours of play!


In addition to coins and Reputation, you can also win gold, which is the game's premium currency, though we shall be discussing how you can win more gold a little later on in this guide. But for now, we can tell you that Career Mode will likely be the mode you will be accessing most of the time in the early goings, as this is clearly a great way to earn the various currencies in the game and increase your player level, as well as farm for all the resources we have mentioned so far.


Don't Try Too Hard To Complete All Three Challenges


As we mentioned when discussing the basics of Mad Skills Motocross 3, the important thing when racing in Career Mode is having a podium finish. That means you shouldn't try too hard to complete all of the three challenges as seen on the left side of the race screen in one go. As the rewards for each task are one-time rewards for the first completion, you can simply focus first on getting that top three finish, and if the challenges are too difficult, you can save them for replays, and, if you have to, complete them one at a time.


For example, performing a certain number of front flips or back flips during a race can be quite tricky, and even if you pull it off successfully, you could lose some ground against your opponents. Meanwhile, finishing a race with a certain number of seconds of time in the air is quite easy and can be completed organically. That means you can complete the latter challenge first, then go back to the other ones when you redo the race. You can replay races at any time you wish, even once you've achieved completion for that race or for the entire tour, so don't put too much pressure on yourself.
