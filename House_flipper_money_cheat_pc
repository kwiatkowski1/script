House Flipper Cheats (Infinite Money & Max Perks)


House Flipper is a unique chance to become a one-man renovation crew. Buy, repair and remodel devastated houses. Give them a second life and sell them at a profit!


House Flipper Cheats


If you want to get maximum perks and level up your abilities, then this guide shows you, how to do that!


Infinite Money


You can fill up your paint roller with any paint then switch to another color without using up anymore paint. This way you can use up your “old paint” before using the “new paint” when painting another room with a different color.


You can also use most of the paint then sell it for a little less than you paid for it.


Maximum Perks / Level Up


Locating the file 
You have to open the file “PlayerProgress.dat” with a texteditor in the following folder: C:\Users\*your name*\AppData\LocalLow\Empyrean\House Flipper Game\Saves\


Editing the value 
There you jump to the section called “skills” and type in the number “9” in the string called “numberOfPerksAvailable”


Here is an example how it has to look for the perks of cleaning:


“skills”: “cleaning”: “eyeOfTheMotherInLaw”: 0, 
“fastHands”: 0, 
“longDistance”: 0, 
“numberOfPerksAvailable”: 9, 
“isCertificated”: false 
>,


Now save and back in the game you have 9 ability points in the category Cleaning. 
Repeat the step and type in the number 9 for all other categories like demolition, painting, building, design, negotiation and handyman!


Another method 
Or you can edit the number behind the single abilities to 3, because 3 is the highest single level you can reach, then it would look like this:


“skills”: “cleaning”: “eyeOfTheMotherInLaw”: 3, 
“fastHands”: 3, 
“longDistance”: 3, 
“numberOfPerksAvailable”: 0, 
“isCertificated”: false 
>,


In this example all abilities in category Cleaning are at maximum level and you have none perks available. But I prefer cheating you 9 points and then you can choose yourself, for what you want to spend it.


Don’t forget 
But don`t forget, you have to edit it for all categories you want; like cleaning, demolition, painting, building, design, negotiation and handyman; I only showed you the example for cleaning.


Editing files is on your own risk, so please create a copy of your files before you edit something!


Note: Ah and… by the way… search for the string “money” in this file and guess what to do with it!
