FIFA 20 Web and Companion Apps Tutorial


If you are new to FUT or if you are not used to the FIFA 20 Web and Companion Apps, maybe you need an extra help to understand how they work. This tutorial is everything you need to start mastering these apps.


FIFA 20 Web and Companion Apps


What these apps do and how to access them?


The FUT Web App and the FUT Companion App are online extensions where you can manage your FUT club via PC and mobile devices, respectively. It is a faster and more comfortable way to search for, sell and buy cards. We already published an extensive guide about these apps. They have both the same features, so we will now explain step by step how to use them.


To access the FIFA 20 Web App, just follow this link. Be aware to only trust web app links from the official EA SPORTS domain names. You can also install the Companion App on your mobile device searching for ‘EA SPORTS FIFA 20 Companion’ on the Google Store or App Store.


Login Verification is a mandatory step before you can access the FIFA 20 Web App. If you never activated, just go to your Origin account here and enable it. Then, just confirm the email or sms they have sent to you, verify your FIFA Ultimate Team Secret question and answer and store your codes in a safe place. As simple as that. If you already did it in the past, all will need is your EA account email address, password and answer to your secret question.


FIFA 20 Web and Companion App early access, also know by FUT Webstart, was only available for returned players. It means that only players who have created a security question/answer before August 1st 2019 were able to use it. This early access expired on October 10.


Main Menu


Every time you log in to FUT Web or Companion App, you’re redirected to the main menu. You can see in the picture its six main areas:


1 ACCOUNT DETAILS 
You can see here the coins and the FIFA Points you own, as well as your ID, established date, your club’s badge and the card view changer button.


Coins 
The amount of coins you own at each moment. It’s the virtual currency used in the game to buy cards or play FUT Draft.


FIFA Points 
The number of FIFA Points available on your account at each moment. You can use them to buy packs on the FUT store or play FUT Draft.


Club’s Name 
The name assigned to your club on your first FUT access. You can change it at any time via objectives.


Est Date 
The month and year you first played FUT. If you are playing since the first year, you are a ‘founder’.


Club’s Badge 
The badge that is active on your club. You can change it at any time on your ‘Club’ menu.


Change Item View 
A button that allows you to change the views of the items when you are in a squad’s menu. There are four views: main view, chemistry attributes, skill and health, and finally chemistry style.


2 NAVIGATION BAR 
It allows you to access the Web and Companion App menus and all its features: home (clicking here you go back to main menu), squads, SBC, transfers, store, club, leaderboards and settings.


3 OBJECTIVES 
It lists both season, dynamic, daily and weekly objectives, as well as milestones. It also lets you see the season progress and which objectives are completed.


4 SHORTCUTS 
Clicking here you can go directly to the three most used features of the companion app: squad building challenges, transfer list and active squad. You cannot customize these shortcuts.


5 SLIDER 
This is used by Electronic Arts to inform the players about the latest news, like new TOTW squads, special cards releases, promo packs available on the FUT store and upcoming events.


6 WEEKEND LEAGUE 
This feature shows you how many FUT Champions points you own, allows you to redeem them and register for the upcoming Weekend League.


Squad’s Menu


Where everything takes place


The squad’s menu allows you to manage everything related to squads. You can see in the picture its three main areas:


1 ACTIVE SQUAD 
You can own several squads on your club but only one can be active at a time. In this sub-menu, you can manage that one.


2 SQUAD MANAGEMENT 
This is used to create new squads, including concept squads. You can also rename them, share them with your friends and choose which is the active one. Opposite to what happens on the Active Squad menu, here you can manage any squad.


3 TEAM OF THE WEEK 
It lists every single TOTW since the game was released. Here you can see the details of each player including their prices on the transfer market.


The Active Squad screen is the most important one and for that reason we will take a closer look.


The squad’s menu allows you to manage everything related to squads. You can see in the picture its three main areas:


1 MAIN AREA 
This is where you actually ‘see’ your squad: how your players link each other, the formation you are using and also your manager, rating, team’s and individual chemistry. Clicking on the change item view, you can also know more about each player. The substitutes and the reserves are hidden in the bottom of the screen.


2 SQUAD DETAILS 
It allows you to change the formation of your squad, rename it, share it or use the squad builder to create the best squad possible from players in your club using pre-set options.


3 PLAYER DETAILS 
When you click in a player, Squad Details are replaced by Player Details. From here, you can make many changes to your team, including listing players on the transfer market, checkng their bio and discarding them. More important than that, you can swap the players from your starting eleven, substitutes and reserves by any other player you own. It is also possible to apply them consumables, like contracts, fitness and healing items.


SBC’s Menu


A different way to play FUT


The SBC’s menu allows you to complete every single challenge released in the game. You can see in the picture its two main areas:


1 CATEGORIES 
With dozens of challenges to complete, EA has provided a navigation bar that allows you to find more easily the SBC you want to do.


2 CHALLENGES 
This is where you can see the list of active challenges. You can start it clicking over it or add to your favourites clicking on the star (right upper corner). The challenges you have submitted can also be found here.


Transfers Menu


The transfers menu allows you to manage everything related to buying and selling cards. You can see in the picture its three main areas:


1 SEARCH TRANSFER MARKET 
This is where you buy cards (players, staff, club items and consumables). You can use the filters to find what you want more easily. After you click in the ‘Search’ button, you are redirected to a new screen where you can see the results from your search. From there, you can make a bid, buy instantly or add a card to your watch list.


2 TRANSFER LIST 
This is where you sell your cards. You will find here all the cards you sent to the transfer market. You can bring them back to your club or active squad, as well as set list them in the market, compare their prices or discard them.


3 TRANSFER TARGETS 
You find here the items you are currently bidding, the items you are watching but have not place a bid, the items you have won through bidding (if you used the Buy Now option, items are moved to the Unassigned section) and finally the expired items that you did not win a bid on.


Store’s Menu


The store’s menu allows you to buy packs. You can pay with both coins or FIFA Points (these ones are only sold on the store’s console). You can see in the picture its two main areas:


1 CATEGORIES 
Gold, Silver and Bronze categories are always available. However, the store only feature Promo Packs in specific times. That is where you can find the best packs.


2 PACKS 
This is where you buy packs. It shows the packs available, their short descriptions and prices. In the case of promo packs you can also see how many packs you can buy and when they expire. If you click in the right upper icon, you can also check the odds of each pack.


Club’s Menu


The club’s menu allows you to visualize and interact with all your cards: players, consumables, staff, kits, badges, balls and stadiums.


In the case of players, you will find stored here all the cards you own but which you are not using in any of your squads (the ones you are using can also be found here). Directly from the Club’s screen you can, for example, extend the contract of one of your players or change the active stadium, ball or stadium.


Leaderboards Menu


The leaderboard menu is an informative screen created to improve the competition on FUT. It doesn’t have nothing to do with the FUT Champions leaderboards, which are not available on the web and companion apps. You can see in the picture its two main areas:


1 CATEGORIES 
There are four rankings in FUT leaderboards and you can navigate between them using these buttons: match earnings (total coins earned from matches); transfer profit (coin profits from purchases, sales and discards); club value (total value of all players in your club); and top squad (combined chemistry and rating scores of your best squad).


2 LEADERBOARDS 
Table featuring the best players for each ranking in each week, month or of all-time. They are identified by their online ID. You can compare yourself with your friends, changing from ‘Top 100’ to ‘Friends’.


Settings Menu


The settings button is placed in the left lower corner of the app window. There are a few features here, like having access to the user agreement and to the privacy and cookie policy, but the most improtant ones are these two:


1 LANGUAGE SELECTION 
It changes the language of the whole app. You can choose between English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Polish, Arabic, Russian and Turkish.


2 PERSONA 
When you click on the ‘Change’ button (right upper corner), you are able to change between different personas associated to your account. Changing a persona will not cause you to lose any of your FUT data.


Quick Sell Recovery


If you’ve quick sold, also known as discarded, a Player Item in FIFA Ultimate Team and want to get it back, you can use Quick Sell Recovery in the FIFA Web and Companion Apps to get it back.


In order to undo a quick sell, you’ll need to the same Coin amount on your account that you got from the initial quick sell. That means if you got 500 Coins from quick selling a Player, you’ll need to have 500 Coins on your account to be deducted once you get the Player back.


How does it work 
1) Log in to the FIFA Web or Companion App. 
2) Select Club. 
3) Select Quick Sell Recovery. 
4) Use the calendar icon to find the day you quick sold the Item you want to get back. 
5) Select the Player Item you want to recover. 
6) Select Recover. The Item you restore will go back to your Unassigned, and we’ll deduct the Coins that you had gotten when you quick sold it initially.


What are the Limitations 
– Only Player Items are recoverable. All other Items cannot be recovered once they’re quick sold. 
– You have 7 days from the time you quick sell an Item to recover it. 
– Quick Sell Recovery is only available in the Web and Companion Apps, so you can only use it for the current version of FIFA. 
– If you delete your Club and create a new one, you cannot recover Player Items from your old Club in Quick Sell Recovery. 
– By default, you can undo five quick sells per 31 day period. Check the Web or Companion Apps to see how many quick sells you have left to recover at any given time. 
– You cannot undo quick sells for Loan Player Items. 
– If you do not use your five recoveries, they do not roll over to the next 31-day period.

FIFA 20 Companion App Early Access


What you need to know about the FIFA 20 Companion App early access 


Returning FUT 19 players whose accounts are in good standing can create their FUT 20 Club, start trading, and claim returning user packs. Early access to the Web and Companion Transfer Market ends at 12:00 a.m. BST on October 9. After that, you’ll need to log in to FUT 20 on your console or PC at least once to continue using both apps.


Early access on the FIFA 20 companion app is not available to everyone. You need to fullfil these conditions:


☑️ You must have created a FUT Club before August 1, 2019, to get early access to the FUT 20 Web and Companion apps. 
☑️ Your FUT 19 account must still exist. 
☑️ Your account needs to be in good standing. If you were banned or had other actions taken on your account in FUT 19, you won’t get early access.


Rewards are based on your account’s good standing in the game, along with your player history and engagement. This is why your rewards may be different from your friend’s. Besides that, returning user rewards are tied to your specific console account. So, if you switch platforms or create a new account on the same platform, your rewards won’t carry over.


FIFA 20 Companion App Menus


Understand how to use the FIFA 20 Companion App 


The FIFA 20 Companion App features five main areas that you can access anytime on the left side of your screen:


1 SQUAD 
Prepare for your next big match while away from your console. Manage your Formations, Players, Managers, and Consumables. Concept Squads allow you to plan your dream team with all Players in FUT.


2 SQUAD BUILDING CHALLENGESs 
Exchange Players from your Club by building unique Squads and meeting the challenge requirements. Once your Squad is complete, submit it to exchange your Players for exciting rewards, such as different SBC Players, Packs, Coins, and more. Complete full challenges on the Companion App and claim your rewards right away, or plan your Squad on mobile and finish it on your console later. New Challenges will be released throughout the year, so check back often!


3 TRANSFER MARKET 
Never miss out on an important transfer and keep tabs on market activity. The Transfer Market lets you list items from your club and bid on new Players, Consumables, and everything needed to build your Ultimate Team! Returning FUT 19 users will have full access to the Transfer Market when the FIFA 20 Companion app launches. New FUT 20 users will need to play a few games on FUT console before access to the Transfer Market is unlocked on the Companion App.


4 FUT STORE 
Build out your Club with Packs that can be purchased with Coins or FIFA Points. The FIFA 20 Companion App ensures you’ll never miss a special Pack offer or lightning round.


5 CLUB 
View and manage all the Players, Consumables and Club Items in your FUT Club directly from the Companion App.

How to get the FIFA 20 companion app? 


Please make sure your device meet the requirements and remember that this app requires you to have an Origin account connected to FIFA 20 (Xbox One, PlayStation 4 or PC).
