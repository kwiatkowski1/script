[FO4] What's this on PS4 about Sim Settlements 2?


I noticed the message in the menu, I play on PS4 and after checking the creation club, and mod featured and search can't seem to find anything.
Is this something on my end? I'm confused.


It's a mod that can't be ported to PS4 due to Sony's restrictions. But the main menu message is the same across all platforms, sorry.


That explains why I couldnt find it on the mod list. That sucks


It's got nothing to do with restrictions. That's bethesda's way of saying they're in bed with Microsoft and we can fuck off.


Bethesda added mod support for consoles long before MS attempts to acquire ZeniMax Media (Bethesda parent company, and the deal is supposed to be finished by the second half of fiscal year 2021), so the restriction is on the Sony's part.


P.S.: Sony only allows mods that use assets that already exist in the game and must be distributed via in-game mods store, while MS only allows mods that can be done in Creation Engine (including any new assets that want to add) and must be distributed via in-game mods store.
