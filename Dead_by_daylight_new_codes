Dead by Daylight codes: your free September Bloodpoints


When it comes to Dead by Daylight, codes are a great way to improve your experience right off of the bat. Even if you're a veteran player, having a few more Bloodpoints never hurts and can add a little bit more spice to your games.


Dead by Daylight is one of the best horror games out there. However, if you want to get the most out of Dead by Daylight, you'll want to get your hands on cosmetics and buy more perks for your characters. To do that, you'll need Bloodpoints. Though they can be obtained through regular gameplay, there are codes you can use to quickly unlock this in-game currency as well as the occasional extra reward. New codes come out every month or so, so be sure to check back with us regularly for more.


Available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, this asymmetrical survival horror game is widely considered a classic entry in the genre, and with good reason.


The asymmetrical nature of the game means that no two experiences are alike, since, rather than fighting for your life against an NPC, you have to match your wits against another human being who will be piloting one of the many killers on offer in the game. From Freddy Kruger to the Demogorgon from Stranger Things, there's something for everyone in this horror melange.

Dead by Daylight codes: how to redeem them


Before you check out our codes, however, you'll first need to know exactly how to redeem them. Here's out step-by-step guide:



  
Launch the game. In the main menu you'll find a button at the bottom right of the screen that'll take you to the store. Give that a click.

  
Once you're in the store, you'll see a 'Redeem Code' button in the top right hand corner of the page.

  
Give that button a click, then you'll be prompted to enter your code.

  
Double check you've entered your code correctly, then click the 'Redeem' button. If successful, you'll see the items you've just received appear on the bottom half of the screen.




These steps are the same across all consoles, so it's just as easy for you to redeem codes on Android or iOS as it is for the folks on PC. Read on to see exactly which codes are currently available, as well as the rewards they'll get you.

Dead by Daylight codes – free Bloodpoints, Fragments, and more


There are few greater joys in videogames than grinding your way to riches galore, allowing you to buy every cosmetic and upgrade that your heart desires. However, it’s also nice to get a little freebie every now and then – be it some extra currency, or that unlockable you’ve been eyeing up.


Fortunately, for Dead by Daylight players, developer Behaviour Interactive added a promo code feature back in 2020’s patch 4.1.0, opening up the option to tap in a (usually limited time) code in return for anything from Bloodpoints to Fragments.


Usually, these codes pop up through the game’s official channels, but sometimes it’s hard to keep up with them all, especially during special events when codes may drop thick and fast. That’s where this handy little guide comes in. Here, we have compiled all the latest Dead by Daylight codes in one easy-to-reference spot.
