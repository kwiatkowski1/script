Best Roblox Promo Codes & Free Items List (April 2023)


If you’re wanting to make a lasting impression in the Roblox community, you’re going to want to obtain as many avatars, in-game cosmetics, and perks as remotely possible.


To acquire such perks, you will need one of two things: Robux, the local currency, or Roblox codes, which you can find stashed away in various spots on the platform, including each game’s respective landing page, on social media, and the Roblox homepage. Or better yet, right here, as we’ll be updating this page with all the latest redeemable codes for the most popular Roblox games.


How to Redeem Promo Codes in Roblox



  
Sign in to your Roblox account on the main website

  
Navigate to the “Redeem Roblox Codes” page

  
Enter any of the active codes in the text box and then click to redeem it




NOTE: If a code isn’t working, then it’s highly likely that it is no longer active. As Roblox creators tend to host codes for limited periods of time, it’s always best to check for updates on a daily basis. Also, due to the complexity of some of the codes, it’s always worth typing in each code manually.


All Active Roblox Promo Codes


Of course, the same method applies for redeeming codes in any of the games on the Roblox platform: log in to your account, and enter the code via the game’s settings menu. You can redeem codes in just about any game on the system, and the codes section is pretty much always located in the same menu.

Free Items List


On top of the redeemable codes that you’ll often find in and around the Roblox platform, you will also have access to a whole bunch of freebies on the official Avatar Shop. To redeem any of the available cosmetics for your avatar, simply follow the link, and select “Get” when prompted. Doing this will automatically add the item to your backpack, which you will be able to equip in the Avatar Editor on the Roblox homepage.


As Roblox is something of an ever-evolving platform, it’s highly likely that there will always be something to collect for your avatar. To see what events and games are currently trending on Roblox, check the Discover tab on your browser.


How to Find More Promo Codes


Promo codes aren’t all that hard to come by in a game like Roblox. That said, active codes don’t tend to stick around for months on end, either, and are often removed from circulation after a seasonal event has transpired, or if the developer makes a snap decision to end one.


The good news is, codes come and go on a weekly basis, and they’re never exactly stashed away behind some form of payment wall, either. Therefore, if you want fresh promo codes for your favorite Roblox game, then aim to check one of the suggestion below.



  
Roblox Homepage: The Roblox homepage should always be your first port of call when it comes to codes, as it is known to host mass giveaways and seasonal events on a daily basis. By checking in with the main page, you may just find new avatar cosmetics, accessories, and clothing items.

  
Social Media: Chances are, each respective developer will host a wide range of codes and giveaways on their social media pages. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, for example, all harbor promotional handles, which are frequently used to clue potential players in on a new event or a code that’s recently surfaced.

  
The Game: It may sound a little too obvious, but the fact is, a lot of codes are often tucked away in the games themselves, and can very well appear in the most absurd places. Therefore, if you’ve exhausted all of your previous options, then be sure to play around in any of the Roblox games on the site. Chances are, there’ll be something right under your nose.




Roblox Promo Codes You Should Avoid


If you happen to find any promo code that advertises free Robux, which is the site’s premium currency, then you should aim to avoid it. Chances are, these will be illegitimate codes, and will potentially harm your account by trying to enter them.


Roblox does, at least every once in a blue moon, host gift card giveaways that can net winners a set amount of Robux. You can tell if the posting is legitimate by checking who the handler is. For example, only websites, affiliates, and developers endorsed by Roblox will post official offers. You should not, under any circumstances, purchase codes from any third-party company that doesn’t bear the Roblox seal of approval.


We’ll be sure to update this page as soon as anything new pops up. In the meantime, be sure to keep tabs on the main Roblox page for all the latest updates and giveaways.
