However, in part II, this problem has been improved. Characters and robots in Star Wars: Kotor II have much smoother action. If compared to the PC game, it is possible that Star Wars: Kotor II still cannot compare enough in terms of graphics quality. But it's still perfect for a mobile game.


However, version IIâ€™s character is not much different from part I, especially since the face is quite lifeless and lacks the characterâ€™s necessary expressions. Anyway, part II has also been upgraded to a better quality than the old version.
