Decal


The Decal object is an object which applies an image to a face of a BasePart .


How does a Decal work?


A Decal will apply an image to the BasePart it is parented to. The surface this image is applied to is dependent on the FaceInstance.Face property. The size of the decal is dependent on the size of the face, meaning the size and aspect ratio of a decal can be changed by changing its parent's BasePart.Size .


The image a Decal applies is determined by its Decal.Texture property. Images can be uploaded to Roblox provided they adhere to the community guidelines.For information on how to upload images, see Textures and Decals .


Alternatives to Decals


Although Decals have a wide variety of applications, in some cases developers may wish to pick one of the following classes instead.


Code Samples


 
-- create part 
 
 local part = Instance.new("Part") 
 
part.Size = Vector3.new(5, 1, 5) 
 
part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 0.5, 0) 
 
part.Anchored = true 
 
part.TopSurface = Enum.SurfaceType.Smooth 
 
part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Toothpaste") 
 
 -- create decal 
 
 local decal = Instance.new("Decal") 
 
decal.Face = Enum.NormalId.Top 
 
decal.Parent = part 
 
 -- create sound 
 
 local sound = Instance.new("Sound") 
 
sound.SoundId = "rbxasset://sounds/uuhhh.mp3" -- oof 
 
sound.Parent = part 
 
 -- define faces 
 
 local happyFace = "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=26424652" 
 
 local sadFace = "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=147144198" 
 
decal.Texture = happyFace 
 
 -- touched event 
 
 local cooldown = false 
 
part.Touched:Connect(function(hit) 
 
 if not cooldown then 
 
 if hit and hit.Parent then 
 
 cooldown = true 
 
 sound:Play() 
 
 decal.Texture = sadFace 
 
 task.wait(1) 
 
 decal.Texture = happyFace 
 
 task.wait(0.2) 
 
 cooldown = false 
 
 end 
 
 end 
 
 end) 
 
 -- add to workspace 
 
part.Parent = workspace


Summary


Properties


Acts as a multiplier for the Decal 's Decal.Transparency property. The effects are only visible to the local player.


The ContentId of the image to be applied by the Decal .


Determines the transparency of the Decal with 0 being completely opaque and 1 completely transparent.


Determines the rendering order when multiple Decals are assigned the same face.


Methods


Events


Properties


Color3


Developers should note that this property only sets the tint of the decal, rather than the color. This means, unless the image associated with the Decal was originally white (RGB = 1,1,1) then the color cannot be freely changed using this property.


By reducing the RGB properties of Color3 in union, developers can make a decal darker.


Code Samples


 
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService") 
 
 local part = Instance.new("Part") 
 
part.Size = Vector3.new(10, 10, 1) 
 
part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 5, 0) 
 
part.Anchored = true 
 
part.Transparency = 1 
 
 local decal = Instance.new("Decal") 
 
decal.Face = Enum.NormalId.Front 
 
decal.Texture = "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=1145367640" -- white circle 
 
decal.Parent = part 
 
part.Parent = workspace 
 
 local redTween = TweenService:Create( 
 
 decal, 
 
 TweenInfo.new(1, Enum.EasingStyle.Linear, Enum.EasingDirection.Out), 
 
 < Color3 = Color3.new(1, 0, 0) > 
 
) 
 
 local greenTween = TweenService:Create( 
 
 decal, 
 
 TweenInfo.new(1, Enum.EasingStyle.Linear, Enum.EasingDirection.Out), 
 
 < Color3 = Color3.new(0, 1, 0) > 
 
) 
 
 local blueTween = TweenService:Create( 
 
 decal, 
 
 TweenInfo.new(1, Enum.EasingStyle.Linear, Enum.EasingDirection.Out), 
 
 < Color3 = Color3.new(0, 0, 1) > 
 
) 
 
 while true do 
 
 redTween:Play() 
 
 redTween.Completed:Wait() 
 
 greenTween:Play() 
 
 greenTween.Completed:Wait() 
 
 blueTween:Play() 
 
 blueTween.Completed:Wait() 
 
 end


LocalTransparencyModifier


Acts as a multiplier for the Decal 's Decal.Transparency property. The effects are only visible to the Players.LocalPlayer .


This property should be used in situations where Decal.Transparency is being set by a different script. The benefit of LocalTransparencyModifier is that it can be changed without concern for the original Decal.Transparency of the Decal 


When LocalTransparencyModifier is set to 1, the Decal will be completely invisible regardless of its original transparency. When it is set to 0, the Decal s rendered transparency will match the Decal.Transparency value. The formula for this is:


 

 
Displayed Transparency = Transparency + ((1 - Transparency) * LocalTransparencyModifier)


Note, this property should be used on the client only and will not replicate to the server.


Texture


The Content ID of the image to be applied by the Decal .


How can I upload a Decal?


Images can be uploaded to Roblox provided they adhere to the community guidelines. For information on how to upload images, see Textures and Decals .


How to find do I find a Decal's Content ID?


Unlike with Sound and Animation objects, the Content ID of a Decal is not the same as the number in the URL. There are two main ways of finding the Content ID of a Decal:


Paste the URL into the Texture property in Roblox Studio. Roblox will automatically update the property to the correct Content ID. Note this only works in Roblox Studio and cannot be done from Scripts or while the game is running.


Insert the Decal into the game, this is generally done through the Toolbox under 'My Decals'. The Content ID can be found in the decal that is inserted. Note, InsertService:LoadAsset() can also be used if developers wish to automate this method.
