What Happens If You Get A Hacked Pokemon


Thankfully, Niantic punishes people who cheat. If youre caught using a GPS spoofer you will find yourself soft banned. A soft ban means you can access the game, but you cant actually play it. If you try to catch a Pokemon it will immediately run away, and youre locked out of Gym Battles and collecting items from Pokestops.


We dont know exactly how long the soft bans last. There have been reports for anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours. It might be dependent on how aggressively youre spoofing the GPS. Pretending to be a few blocks away vs pretending to be in a major city a few states away. Its also possible that multiple soft bans can lead to a permanent ban, but we dont know for sure. Basically, if youre caught cheating, the game is going to be very annoying for a couple of hours.

The Pokmon Is Too Good To Be True


Hackers know how to make Pokémon appear legitimate, and it will generally be difficult to tell if it isnt. A huge telltale sign is if one seems too good to be true. A legitimate player is not likely to send out something valuable in a surprise trade when they could save it for themselves or use it to gain value in a trade.


Hackers tend to create shiny Pokémon, Pokémon with Pokérus, and level 100s with six perfect IVs and competitive movesets. Receiving any of these in a surprise trade probably means that it is hacked.


On the other hand, any Pokémon that is level one was likely bred and traded away. These are generally legitimate even if they have great IVs or egg moves. Unless it is shiny or has Pokérus, it should be safe to use or breed.


Nintendo Vows To Ban Hacked Pokemon And Cheaters


If youre a regular player of Pokemon Sword and Shield youve probably noticed things have looked a little odd in the recent two or three months. You hop into a raid with three random people online and before the match starts theres a brief pause as suddenly everyone in your party has an animation of sparkles coming off them. Everyone youre teamed up with is using a shiny.


Or you do a Surprise Trade only to receive a shiny in a special Pokeball. At first, you get excited but then you realize that your Pokemon has been named either a website that sells hacked Pokemon or someones Twitch stream where they hack Pokemon. I got one like this here but I covered the name with something equally relevant. You can still see their original name at the top.


Im not a betting man, but theres a good chance a lot of these Pokemon, especially the ones in trades, are hacked and my goodness it is a problem. Online battles are absolutely filled with shiny hacked Pokemon with perfect stats and moves and abilities that arent normally available.


Luckily, Nintendo of Japan recently issues a statement that a massive wave of bans was coming. People discovered using hacked Pokemon and altering their save data were going to just be banned. No more access to online features. No more raids with people. No more Dynamax adventures with other people. No more trades. Period.


And this doesnt just apply to Pokemon Sword and Shield but also Pokemon Home.

Deadly Shock: Receiving A Hacked Pokmon From Surprise Trade Will Alter Your Copy Of Sword And Shield


Pokémon is a series that dares you to catch em all. Its a sickness for which there is no cure. Once you start down the path, there is no going back.

The Level Up Pokmon Go Hack


The levelling up hack is a classic hack used by many players to level up your character and Pokémon fast. To do this, you need to catch a truckload of weak Pocket Monsters such as Caterpie, Pidgey and Weedle.;


Next, you need to use a lucky egg to earn double XP in 30 minutes. Once used, level up as many of the Caterpie, Pidgey and Weedle as possible until evolution, allowing you to max out your experience points and level up your character.;


This technique is helpful for new players starting with the game, allowing you to level up fast with minimum effort.


For more veteran players, it is still used but to a lesser extent. If you perform this hack properly, you can hit over 80 evolutions in 30 minutes, maximising your XP.


Gamers Using Hacked Pokmon Are Ruining The Joy Of Trading


Twitter user , known for their datamining skills, issued a message via the social media platform urging caution when using Surprise Trade. Receiving any glitched Pokémon imported into ones copy of Sword and Shield will cause a crash when the player tries to utilize the online component. Doing so will block any usage of online features and the only way around it is hoping for a patch.


Also, the game might crash right after receiving a borked Pokémon via trade. Thankfully, releasing the monster will fix any issues. Regardless of which misfortune you run into, your saved data should be fine.


Cheaters are bringing the community down just to have Pokémon not available in Sword and Shield. With this knowledge in mind, I believe its best to just avoid Surprise Trade altogether, for the time being.

How To Tell If A Pokmon Is Hacked In Sword And Shield


Ever since the earliest Pokémon games in the 90s, people have found ways to hack the games and create Pokémon. It didnt take long for people to find ways to do this in Pokémon Sword and Shield.


Players will often send their hacked Pokémon out into the world via surprise trades. They can also be great bargaining chips for players looking to get something from someone else. Hacked Pokémon are not supposed to be used in competitive play, but it is often difficult to tell whether one is legitimate or hacked. Here are some tips.


The Pokemon Company Is Cracking Down On Sword And Shield Hackers With An Incoming Ban Wave


The Pokemon Company has issued a notice warning Pokemon Sword and Shield players of an incoming “ban wave” aimed at hackers who have been modifying their save data.


Per a report from noted Pokemon news source Serebii.net, The Pokemon Company is looking at Sword and Shield players as well as Pokemon Home users who might be using altered data and thereby breaking the terms of service. Guilty trainers will reportedly be banned from online play, trading, and Pokemon Home entirely. Depending on the situation, The Pokemon Company could issue temporary or permanent pans.


The Pokemon Company’s renewed focus on hacking seems to be related to an increase in Pokemon Sword and Shield hackers using exploits to get rare Pokemon that weren’t caught legitimately, in some cases affecting the experience of other players. As we reported last year, some Pokemon Sword and Shield players coincidentally received modded Pokemon via the Surprise Trade feature, resulting in corrupted saves and other issues. In some cases, hackers would even send maliciously bugged Pokemon to players and crash their games, sometimes impeding the player’s access to online features.


, there are likely people who are unaware that they’ve been given a hacked Pokemon through Surprise Trade. It’s unlikely those players need to worry about being banned, but we’ve reached out to Nintendo for clarification and will update this article if we hear back.


Illegal Abilities Or Moves


Each Pokémon in;Sword and Shield has a specific set of abilities and moves that they can learn. These moves are referred to as legal. If a Pokémon has a move or ability that it cannot learn naturally, it is hacked and cannot be used in competitive play.


An example of this would be if a Cinderace had the ability Sturdy or the move Hydro Pump. It cannot have this ability or learn this move, so the only way to get them would be through hacking. This is fairly rare, but its still worth looking out for.


Use Surprise Trade At Your Own Risk


Pokemon;bugs are no joke: especially if they mess with a hundreds-of-hours-long save file or creatures youve lovingly doted on. While this particular bug wont corrupt your save file, it will crash your game.


Confirmed by the Pokemon Sword;and Shield;community and datamining champion Kaphotics, it looks like there are malicious Pokemon swimming around the Surprise Trade feature. If you happen to get one of these mons your game will crash if you try to utilize any online components; and according to some, you wont be able to do so until the game is patched.


According to Kaphotics, itll even crash after the trade itself , so make sure to release it after that happens. Or just dont risk using the Surprise Trade feature for now, as lovely as it is.


In other news, Pokemon Home just launched on Switch and iOS, and youll get a free Pikachu and Generation 1 starter for signing up.


Can You Tell If A Pokemon Is Hacked


The only way to find out is to look it up. If you find out that the pokemon has moves that it shouldnt have, it is probably hacked. If your pokemon comes in an illegal ball, then you know it is hacked. The starters only come in standard poke balls, so if you get one in a different ball, it is probably hacked.
