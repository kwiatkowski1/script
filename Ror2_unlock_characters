Survivors


Survivors are the various playable characters available in Risk of Rain 2, each with their own unique abilities. Players start with only the Commando Commando The Commando is a jack-of-all-trades character that is reliable in all situations of the game. 
Class: Ranged 
HP: 110 (+33 per level) 
Damage: 12 (+2.4 per level) 
Umbra: Cornered Gunslinger and Huntress Huntress The Huntress is an extremely mobile but fragile survivor with a high damage output. 
Class: Ranged 
HP: 90 (+27 per level) 
Damage: 12 (+2.4 per level) 
Umbra: Judge, Jury, Executioner available, and can unlock the rest by accomplishing various Challenges. Survivors are known as such due to the result of a space-bound catastrophe, although in RoR2 the case is revealed by the game's lore to be on a rescue mission aboard the UES Safe Travels, sent to look for the remains of RoR1's UES Contact Light. In this case, it's likely the name "Survivor" is used simply because it was also used in RoR1, not because it has significance to the plot of RoR2.


There are currently fourteen playable Survivors (the Railgunner and Void Fiend being available in the DLC Survivors of the Void).
