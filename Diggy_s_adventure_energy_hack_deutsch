Energy


Energy is the most important thing in Diggy's Adventure. It enables you to dig tiles. As you progress through the Regions tile costs go up and it is important you keep upgrading your underground Camp Equipment to match that.


One of the "tricks" to playing Diggy is to try to never have your Energy Regeneration stop and have it regenerate as much per hour as possible. To do that you will have to:



  
Be active, and change your underground camp set-up often, and make it fit your daily schedule. 
(When online you set it up so it fills fast, when offline you set it up to fill in the time you are away from the game). The Professor's Switch can help you save some time there.

  
Upgrade your equipment! Each time you level up more equipment unlocks in the shop. A full list of Camp Equipment can be found HERE

  
Higher regions have much better equipment and reaching high regions fast can be a game strategy (Rushing).

  
Buy equipment with Event tokens.

  
Purchase equipment in sales. Offer prices can be set at a fixed or maximum level that you feel comfortable with (by sending a Message to Support).

  
Dig out your underground camp to be able to place more equipment.



  
Cook as much as you can.



  
Neighbours: Only for players who have their accounts connected to a Facebook account and a PC version. It makes a huge difference to be able to have the extra options of the social Neighbour system, especially at lower levels in the game. Benefits: 

  
Visit Neighbours for extra energy

  
Gifted materials help a lot (send/receive Gifts). 



  
Purchase the Holland system (found under the 'Extra' tab in your Shop). This will increase the maximum number of Windmills you can have in your camp from 5 to 8.

  
Purchase 15 'Rotor Enhancer Upgrades' (found in the Shop under the 'Extra' tab. This will give you one energy per hour, per windmill extra. Total maximum increased energy per hour is 176.

  
Purchase the 'Energy Saver Upgrades'. This is a 10 level upgrade available in the shop for Gems. Each Level returns some of the energy spent removing Tiles. (Comes in increasing percentages, which are small, but add up over time.)




 
It is one thing to generate energy, it is another to try to reduce the Energy Requirements and maybe even have a more enjoyable game. 
One of the major short-cuts in the game is what some call 'Rushing' Mines, although the name is a bit misleading. 
What you actually do is try to complete the objectives of each Task/Quest(as you play through the game), by digging as few Tiles as possible (as the design of the mine allows you), and therefore spend much less energy(depending on the mine, you can save 25-80% of the energy required to fully clear it). Also, all side/extra-quests are skipped for now. 
Then, at a later stage - when you have a much higher Regeneration Speed - you can decide to go back to these mines and fully clear them. By then the tiles will be relatively cheap, and you can play for longer periods. 
The advantages of this style of playing the game (opposed to fully clearing each mine right away) are as follows: 



  
Quicker to reach a higher Region, with much better underground-camp equipment and materials.

  
Reach the Region 'New World' years sooner, compared to a strategy of fully-clearing mines(can also be considered a downside).

  
Faster level-ups giving you that bonus energy to play with.

  
Better value for purchases.

  
Less tiles, less energy, less "pressure". 




The goal of all of this is not so much speeding things up, but rather being able to play for longer periods. Some players still decide to choose the 'Fully-clearing Method', which also has its own benefits.


Underground Camp equipment


Setup


More information about how to setup your camp can be found on the Professor's Switch System Page 


Regeneration Equipment


Generating energy is very important. 
Each level-up more equipment unlocks. So check the shop often and upgrade. 
Events give the best equipment by spending the event-tokens on equipment. 
More information about Regeneration equipment on the Shop-Campequipment page.


Capacity Equipment


Capacity equipment is used to store the energy you generate over time. 



  
If you login often then you need little blue Capacity equipment.

  
If you login a couple times per day you need a lot of blue Capacity equipment.




Events give the best equipment by spending the event-tokens on equipment. 
More information about Capacity equipment on the Shop-Campequipment page 


Kitchen


Cooking extra food in your Kitchen can be a major factor in generating energy you can use at will. Of course not everyone has the time to cook the best dishes non stop all the time. More information about the Kitchen and recipes on the Kitchen page.

Frequently asked questions


Q: I did not see the screen with rewards and could not click it! Does that mean I did not receive the reward? 
A: No you get the reward even if you miss the window for some reason. The prize is awarded when the ad is done. 


Q: What time does the daily reward popup interface show up? 
A: The window pops up at midnight for players using CE(S)T (Central European Time). There have been reports that players from other countries experience this during a different time of the day. The time of reset is fixed. You will claim the daily bonus after logging for the first time on any given day.


Q: If I don't collect my reward on a given day will I start from the beginning? 
A: No, even if you skip one day, when you come back you will start where you left off, not from the beginning.


Q: What if my level is 101, how will the formula work then? 
A: The formulae round all values down, so a 101 level person will receive 50 apple pies, not 50.5 and not 51. Also, for energy gifts, the system seems to round them to 100s, so if you were supposed to get 3350 energy, you will get 3400 (or 3300).


Windmills


 
Available on both the Facebook and Portal website versions of the game only. However, you must also have your game connected to a Facebook account. 
When you start out in the game you can have a maximum of 5 windmills in your camp. These give you energy per hour. The whole system is expandable to an extra 176 energy per hour.
Your neighbors have to place them in your camp. And you in turn place them in their camps.



  
The only way to get Windmills is to get them gifted from neighbors as a daily gift.Your neighbors will send them to you.

  
You cannot use them in your own camp; they are for you to place in your neighbor's camps and Mr. Bill (for working on the windmill achievement).

  
The number of windmills you have is listed under extra's in your inventory.

  
Windmills last for 7 days. Many Facebook groups for the game have a pinned post to request them.



  
To place a windmill in your neighbor's camp. Click on the Friends icon. Once in their camp you can see on their Windmill if they need any placed. 0/8 means your neighbor needs 8 new mills. There's no real need to go visit all your neighbors each day to see if they maybe need one. You will get to visit a part of your neighbors that day to collect the extra energy and a quick look at those windmills should suffice as your part of the deal.



  
Windmills are also an Achievement. Each windmill earns you 5 Experience points. You will need to place over 17,000 to complete the achievement. Placing windmills on Mr. Bill's camp counts towards this achievement, he also "sells" his mills every time you refresh his camp so you can place windmills there all day long as many times as you want.




Holland System


Upgrade for the Windmills. By purchasing this (in the shop under extras) you can increase your max windmills allowed from 5 to 8. 
More information on the Shop-Extra's page 


Rotor Enhancer


Upgrade for the Windmill system. This increases the output of all your windmills by 1 energy per hour. 
More information on the Shop-Extra's page 


God's Children


Found in mines


God's Children can be found in the God-mines throughout the regional and event mines. They give you an instant amount of energy.


The amount of energy you receive from the Godchildren in the regular quest mines will vary depending on where you are in the story line. The energy you receive by collecting godchildren in game from quest mines is your own personal energy and has no bearing on godchildren energy for neighbors.


Found in camps of Neighbors


You also get to visit some of your neighbors to collect from their godschildren/energy. This is energy that is not taken from your neighbor but yours to collect and in return you leave the same amount for them. New GC will become available at your neighbors' camps every 22 hours. Whether you immediately collect them or not, the 22 hr timer restarts first time you login and there are Neighbors showing in the Friends/Neighbors tab. The number of neighbors you get to visit depends on the number of Facebook friends playing the game you have as listed below.


One Click God Children


A tool that will let you collect all 5 Godchildren in your neighbor's camp with one click instead of 5 clicks, saving you time. Purchasable in the SHOP under the extra tab.

We all start with 1 visit to Mr. Bill daily even without friends/neighbors.


You might have more than 5000 neighbors due to Facebook bug but the number visits is still max at 74.


Energy Sent/Received


It is important to note, that you can get energy from friend only when you open game (If you still open Diggy game tab, the game count as you are absence and you will not get energy from friend until you reload game.) and no matter how many friends visit your camp during your absence, your incoming energy reward will be limited when you open game again. The limits are region-based: 


Egypt: 2 000 
Scandinavia: 4 000 
China: 6 000 
Atlantis: 8 000 
Greece: 10 000 
New World: 12 000 
Terra: 14 000 
Mars: 16 000 


If you stay logged out from the game and get more energy from your neighbors at that time than the limit, that energy will be lost. However, there is no limit energy per day that you can get from friend send.


When visiting the Neighbors in your Friends/Godchildren tab, you can collect energy from God Children in their camp. This does NOT take any energy away from anyone. You are earning the energy and sending that energy to them in the same amount as you earn. How much energy you will receive for the visit depends on the level and region of your Neighbor.
