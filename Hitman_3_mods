HITMAN 3 Mod Framework


If you are a modder and want to use the framework, download the modder tools below and read its readme. For offline content, it mostly boils down to placing your resources in the right folders and using the framework's tools when referencing other resources in the content pack.


Translations 


The framework has translation support. Bundled content currently comes with the following translations:


If you want to translate bundled content to a different language or want to improve existing translations, edit the files in Framework\2 Offline Content\translations and send me the resulting file.


Credits: The mod framework includes rpkg-cli from the amazing rpkg project that enables HITMAN modding in the first place, ResourceTool from the equally amazing ZHMTools project that gives modders access to large parts of the engine and a copy of Python to permit you to run it without installing anything.

Hitman 3 mods


The Simple Mod Framework provides users an easy way to create and install mods to the game with a simple tool that does all the work of handling the files of the game and the mods.
Think of it as your typical mod loader. This method is also the only way you could merge mods together that would otherwise be incompatible due to conflicting files or whatever.
Some mods might even require this framework to be installed instead of the old traditional method.


To set it up, download it first and then extract the files of the zip archive to where HITMAN 3 is installed. Steam users should be able to find it on an address exactly like this or similar to this:


You can find it easily by right clicking on the game on your Steam Games Library and click on "Manage > Browse local files".


Once you've moved the files to the game's directory, you can start the tool by running the "Mod Manager.cmd" file inside the "Simple Mod Framework" folder.


When you're ready and you have a mod that requires the framework, have the tool running, use the "Import Framework Zip" option and select the downloaded zip of the mod.
If the mod is in a ".rpkg" format, use the "Import RPKG Mod" option instead and select the .rpkg file. Enable the mods you want to use and then select "Deploy Mods" to apply them to the game.


This framework also comes with an option to skip the intro splash screen that plays every time you start up the game, isn't that neat?


NOTE: The mod needs to be released or updated for SMF 2.0 in order to work with it. 
Mods that were made for SMF 1.0 won't work with SMF 2, although you could manually edit their manifest JSON file to make them compatible with SMF 2 and it might still work just fine.


Before the Simple Mod Framework, we had to follow this method of modding the game.
I recommend you use the method above instead since it is supposed to make modding easier, it solves the incompatibility problem of multiple mods that overwrites files rather than adding on to them, non-RPKG mods need the framework while RPKG mods can still be used by the framework anyway. But if you insist though, continue reading this section of the guide.


First of all, you need to patch the "packagedefinition.txt" file so the game can load up these mods.


You can either use Hardware's Package Definition Patcher [www.nexusmods.com] to automatically patch the file or this online editor [notex.app] to edit the encrypted "packagedefinition" file.


If you're using the online editor: just click on "Set Patch Levels", save it as a .txt file then replace the original "packagedefinition.txt" file with the edited one.


The reason why we have to do this, is so we can tell the game to load up more than the initial number of patches for the base game's chunks (assets) and mods are the patches (addons).
You only have to patch that file once unless the game updates itself or it's been reinstalled. 
Take note that some mods may already come with their own "packagedefinition.txt" files which if they do, it might be best to use them instead by having it overwrite the previous existing ".txt" file to ensure the mod fully works.


The "packagedefinition.txt" file should be located in an address like this:


Once you got your "packagedefinition.txt" file patched/replaced, mods should now be able to load in the game.


The "Runtime" folder will be the location where you place the mods, which is where the game's assets and patches are as the game's been programmed to load up assets and patches from that particular folder.


Most mods are usually named "chunk0patchX" in ".rpkg" format with the "X" being a number.
It could be any number as long as it doesn't already exist so if there's already a "chunk0patch4.rpkg", "chunk0patch5.rpkg" or so on, then be sure to change the number of the latest RPKG file to the next consecutive number. 
DO NOT rename it to just "chunk27" or whatever, it must be "chunkXpatchX".


If you follow either of the two methods correctly, you could have your game look like this if the mod(s) edits the logo, menu backgrounds and the text to not be UPPERCASED: 
Keep in mind that some mods like the ones that affect gameplay, missions and locations may only work in Offline Mode as they will be overridden by files from IO Interactive's online servers. 
When you start up the game while you're online on Steam, you may have the option of cancelling the connection to IOI's servers. Do that to play the game in Offline Mode.
Alternatively, you could just start Steam in offline mode and play the game that way. 


Mods that I recommend you should have to improve the Hitman experience.
The paragraph written in italics is me explaining why I think these mods are essential.
Admittedly, some of them are preferential but there's also some that really enhances the game.

Improves offline mode with more features, adds existing content that isn't available offline (eg. Seasonal missions/escalations) and modded/custom missions (incl Solo Ghost Mode, Choose Your Adventure mode).


This mod enables the main content that is not in vanilla offline mode, and improves upon content by adding more features/choice such as more spawns in some missions, difficulties, VR and unrestricted loadouts. It also ports over most of the custom missions I made for H2, they are only playable in offline mode or Peacock. 
You will require the H1 and H2 Access Passes to access the missions.


Not only do you have additional custom content that you can play around with in offline mode, some of the official content from IOI that are arbitrarily unavailable in offline mode can now be accessed without needing an internet connection. I mean come on, there's no good reason why Sniper Assassin and some missions like the holiday ones shouldn't be available offline.
Lastly, the offline experience has been improved with more items, difficulty options and VR for bonus missions, added starting locations for some missions, unrestricted loadout, and more.

You may have heard of The Brothers - Renzo and Orlando Caruso - a cut Elusive Target from Season 1 set at night time Marrakesh. A mod restores them in Hitman 2, and one briefly did in H3 before IO went out of their way to make it hard to restore.


Well, for the first time on Nexus and SMF since IO put this content on their deletion lists, they're back! And they're better than ever!


You hear that right, this is restored official content made by IO Interactive that never got to see the light of day (or night rather). 
Not only is this mission restored, it's also been further enhanced.
This mod might not actually be essential but I put it here because if you're craving for more official Hitman content, you should check out the lost Elusive Target mission that would've appeared in HITMAN (2016).

Nope! No need to pinch yourself, you're not dreaming. 
The Sarajevo Six can now be played on Hitman 3 on PC!


The Sarajevo Six was originally exclusive content for the PlayStation 4 version of HITMAN 2016.
It's a mini campaign where 47 does his usual job of assassinating the target in each location of the first game. It's just a nice additional content to have but unfortunately for some reason, IOI didn't bring this content over to the later two games and they have no plans in doing so.
Considering this is official content ported to the PC version of HITMAN 3, I say this is essential. 
Not necessarily essential to have but essential to enhance the experience if you want official content.


DOWNLOAD [www.nexusmods.com] 
Adds an "Elusive Targets' button to the dashboard, from where you can play all elusive targets as often as you like!


Do I even have to say why this is essential? It's a bunch of official content no longer being arbitrarily locked after being available for a short period of real time, meaning you can finally play them anytime you want, more than once, and they're available in offline mode. 
Comes with its own menu of selecting Elusive Targets to play too.

This mod significantly improves visual clarity, accessibility, and aesthetic choices.
Eliminates arbitrary effects and filters, significantly reduces bloom, and makes critical changes to skyboxes and color correction.


I believe this mod truly improves the lighting and post-filtering that IOI could've done themselves but wouldn't. Lighting Ultimate comes with options for each location so if you want certain maps to look nicer while keeping the rest the same, you can do that. The 2016 maps in particular have options to resemble its original lighting from the first game or improve upon the vanilla lighting from HITMAN 3. It also fixes the very glaring issues regarding the excessive bloom in the game which I'm not trying to make a pun, it's really glaring that hurts the visual clarity of the game. 
I highly recommend this mod.


DOWNLOAD [www.nexusmods.com] 
Replaces the US/UK accents of many international NPCs with ones that sound *slightly* more fitting.


If I'm playing a game where I travel around the world, I expect a level of immersion where people speaks with an accent if they're not speaking in their native language. It's a real missed opportunity for HITMAN 2016 where everyone sounds American/British instead regardless of the location. This mod is the closest thing we'll ever get to have NPCs sound a little closer to where they're actually from, even if it's not exactly accurate.


DOWNLOAD [www.nexusmods.com] 
Makes the objective text more readable, improves minimap clarity and removes ALL CAPS from almost all UI text. Works online.


Have you ever wanted the H2016 HUD back? Well too bad, but this is the next best thing! Increases the objective text size, makes most of the UI proper case and removes the vignette and colour bleed from the minimap. Also makes the NPC dots more visible by adding an outline.


I don't know about you but I don't think almost every UI text needs to be all UPPERCASE and the minimap shouldn't have a vignette effect unless you're hidden.
This mod does what I want to make the UI neater and more readable.


DOWNLOAD [www.nexusmods.com] 
Allows starting contracts by their metadata ID. Allows PC players to play cross-platform contracts. 
(e.g. Steam <> Epic, Steam <> PS4)


If you ask me, being able to play contracts from other platforms would've been great. 
If there's an unique and creative contract you wanted to play but you can't simply because it was made on a different platform, this mod is for you.
And considering there's more than one PC version of the game where the playerbases are segregated for some reason, this mod makes accessing PC contracts less of a hassle. 


Mods that edits or changes the game's mechanics, items and weapons globally.

The AI in Hitman 3 is stupid. Even on the highest difficulty, people sometimes just ignore things like footsteps behind them, the sound of choking or a man in a flamingo outfit crouched down running across a hallway. This mod aims to fix some of this. 
There are three versions: Normal, Manhunt and Extreme.

This mod replaces 47's movement animations with Hitman 2's. For some reason, IOI decided to make basically all of 47's movement speeds faster for Hitman 3. Some animations are clearly the same ones sped up, and others are new and (in my opinion) very poor quality.

There's more mods out there than just the ones listed on this "featured mods" guide.


By “featured”, I mean mods that I find interesting that other people should check out, because there’s already so many mods on Nexus that I just want to highlight on the ones I like or at least noteworthy in my opinion. It makes it easier for me to update this guide whenever a interesting mod comes out as oppose to filling up this guide by adding almost every single one like I did with a previous guide.


You can find most of these mods on Nexus Mods [www.nexusmods.com] while some are exclusively available on a certain modding discord server down below.


If there's a mod you think it should be on the list, feel free to suggest it.
Though I may not accept it if I don't find it substantial enough like if it's just another existing suit replacing the Signature Suit, I don't care. A mission mod that could be made with the game's own Contract Creator? Not interested. Reshade presets? Don't bother since we can literally edit the game's lighting and post-processing filters. 
Also, I will not be accepting any mods, barring The Peacock Project, that unlocks any or all unlockables that aren't unused regardless of your progression from the official Online Mode.


Another thing; if you made a bunch of mods (such as apparels) that could easily be part of a single mod collection (i.e. Gar0npeX Tailor Kit), please make that collection so I can save space for other mods before I reach the character limit and it also gives me less time-consuming work to deal with the next time I update this guide. Thank you.
