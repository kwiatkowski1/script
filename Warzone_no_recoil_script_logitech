  --SETTINGsS AND VALUES   --Standard no recoil settings, setting min and max means, that you roll values inbetween the two values, and hopefully making the script seem at bit more legit.   --Please remember this is a simple no recoil script and can only move your mouse down vertically at a varying speed.   --if you want flat value delete="math.random(AltPressSpeedMin,AltPressSpeedMax)" and input value. Example: "Sleep(30)", this works for all of them.   --Please try out different settings to fit it to your sensitivity and feel, personally i keep the mp7 as my baseline for norecoil and Famas for my rapidfire. dpi=600, sens ca. 5,5   --heard something about keeping values local as sort of an etiquette for coders, velp sorry if all the global values hurts your eyes.   --NoRecoil   NoRecoilMin=1,6 --Change this   NoRecoilMax=3 --Change this   HorizontalRecoilModifier=0 --try this if your gun only moves to one side, I will not be making profiles for this script, but you can keep it open and change values for each gun when in game.   SleepNRMin=6 --Change this   SleepNRMax=17 --Change this   --Tagging settings(ms), this is also a recoil predelay, the longer this takes, the longer it takes for your no recoil to start   AltPressSpeedMin=20 --Change this   AltPressSpeedMax=30 --Change this   InBetweenSpeedMin=20 --Change this   InBetweenSpeedMax=50 --Change this   --Rapidfire   PressSpeedMin=10 --Change this   PressSpeedMax=30 --Change this   NoRecoilRFMin=14 --Change this   NoRecoilRFMax=26 --Change this   SleepNRFMin=35 --Change this   SleepNRFMax=125 --Change this   --BINDS   --Enable/Disable, only scrollock capslock and numlock work for this bind: "scrolllock", "capslock", "numlock", you canalso delete: " if IsKeyLockOn(LockKey)then ", if you want it all at all times.
