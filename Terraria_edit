* Block Shuffle Plugin Adds a plugin that simply takes all blocks in a selected area, and randomises their position. The plugin-view also got alphabetically sorted. * Block Shuffle Plugin (Update) Implemented an option to include Tile-Entities (off by default) (some special entities are still excluded when turned on). Optimized the options window.

Tool TEdit - Terraria Map Editor


Hey. 
Does anyone have made excessive use of cutting objects with tedit? For example: Just using half of a statue, half of furnitures or whatever. 
I wanted to know if there's any potential danger regarding a broken/corrupted map data.


Hi there @Warden Shape I moved your post into this thread for TEdit so that more people that may know the answer can see it.

Hello all, i'm enjoying my time but would love a hardmode world without the V biomes spread. I have checked and you can toggle the Hardmode status of a world in TEdit, however this does not spawn a V upon entering the world as I would have suspected, however I'm unable without spending much time to defeat the Wall of Flesh yet. Does anyone know if this bypasses the V creation?


Created a small test world, edited it to be in Hardmode. The Wall of Flash was marked as already defeated by TEdit. Saved and fought the Wall of Flesh. After 1 day in game time, no spirits were released and no hallow was created.


Can you modify your character after creating them?


When you create your character, you can choose to alter their appearance. After doing that, is it possible to change any aspect of your character later on? Thanks!


Gender change potion - self explanatory


Yes it is possible. You can do so by talking with the stylist or with the use of a dresser. I think that is all. Besides all this you always have vanity sets and dye that you can use. :)


this comment is kinda old but my character is bald but could i add hair to him?


It depends on the version you are playing. On PC you can change your base clothing with a dresser and hairstyle when you find the Stylist. On other versions (console/mobile) those options might not be in the game yet.


I think you can just put all your stuff in a chest and make a new one as well? Is there any downside to doing this?


You'd lose all the health and mana you accumulated on your first character, that's about it.


I regret making my mains skin pink because it seemed amusing at the time. Can I fix this?


With a third-patty game editor, yes.


You can't change your skin color yet.


TerraSavr Is a web based inventory editing tool, which not only allows you to get items, but can also edit your character's appearance.


terrasavr is the best one, just know it doesn't preview the default clothing. http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Character_styles http://yal.cc/r/terrasavr/doc/
