About


The best Genshin Impact ReShade mod pack with custom graphics presets and FPS Unlocker. 2023


Would it be possible to mod characters by changing their models or textures


It depend on how often the game check the file, you might be able to do it, but you have a good chance of getting banned for tempering with game files.


Such a shame, I'm really not interested in playing a bunch of preteens and 14 year old girls. Would be amazing if the characters could be aged up


Why dont you ask them directly yourself


Not many devs openly allow their games to be modded without some kind of drawback or if it's offline only so I'm not entirely sure.
