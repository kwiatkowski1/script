Dead By Daylight Free Bloodpoint Codes - 150K Bloodpoints Giveaway


Dead by Daylight Bloodpoints act as the asymmetric multiplayer horror game's main progression currency, being required to level up each character. With the sheer amount of Killers and Survivors on offer, free codes can provide some invaluable help, especially to newer players.


Dead By Daylight free Bloodpoint codes are given out on a rather irregular basis, which is why we've put together this article that aims to clearly point out any active ones, so you can get closer to leveling that new character you've had your eye on recently.


DBD Free Bloodpoint Codes


There's only currently one Bloodpoint code available at the moment, which you should be able to redeem, although we're unsure how long it will be active so you'll need to be fairly quick. If we spot any others we'll add them to this page very quickly.


You can redeem Dead By Daylight free Bloodpoint codes by going to the Store, clicking on the Redeem Code button at the top right side of the menu, typing the code in the dialog box, then pressing Redeem. The currency should automatically be added to your account.


We'll keep an eye out and update this list with new Dead By Daylight Bloodpoint codes as soon as we spot them.

Gameplay Gallery


Play Killer or Survivor


Choose a role and live up to its name. Killers play an intense first-person perspective to better focus on their prey, while Survivors play in third person for greater awareness.


The Thrill of the Hunt


Rev your chainsaw, set some bear traps, become invisible, and much more. Practical or supernatural, each Killer has a unique power to master as you hunt and sacrifice Survivors.


Survival is Better Together


Will you be a leader? A hero? An escape artist? Discover the skills of each Survivor and be the last one standing – or better yet – the reason you all make it out alive.


Unpredictable Multiplayer Action


Experience the thrill of the unknown every time you play. All maps are procedurally generated, and all spawn-points randomized, so Killers and Survivors never know what to expect.


Rewarding Progression


Complete objectives, level up your characters, and earn Bloodpoints in every trial to unlock powerful new Items, Offerings, Perks, Add-Ons, and more
