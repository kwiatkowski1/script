Admin Panel [Private Servers]


This gamepass grants the player to access admin commands that only work on private servers. This pass gives private server owners the following powers:



  
Change gravity

  
Change walkspeed

  
Enable/disable natural Live Competitions and Races

  
Flight (can also press B at any time)

  
Instantly fill the Core (at the cost of no reward)

  
Kick players from the server

  
Send server-wide shout messages (can also use the /shout command in chat)

  
Teleport players




The server owner may also choose to provide admin powers to players within their server.


2x Juggernaut


Anyone who has purchased this gamepass will have their chance of being picked as the Juggernaut in Derby doubled. For example, if a person's base chance is 16%, it will be doubled to 32%, making them much more likely to be chosen as the Juggernaut.


Crowbar


This gamepass grants its purchaser a permanent crowbar tool that can be found in their backpack. The crowbar is swung by left-clicking. It will break vehicles apart wherever it strikes them, allowing the user to manually destroy their vehicle. Small parts will vaporize, and larger parts will bend or break off. It is primarily used to quickly destroy small vehicles or to break up parts of larger vehicles that will not fit into crushers easily.


Energy Core Access


This gamepass unlocks access to the control room of the Energy Core, which can be found in the basement of the Destruction Facility. Players must descend a spiral staircase found in the Lobby to reach the energy core. The control room is located in the back, and buttons exist here to both charge up and detonate the energy core.


Additionally, anyone who owns this gamepass will gain 200 Credits for surviving the explosion, rather than the base 125 Credits.


Extra Colors


This gamepass unlocks an extended selection of 15 premium colors for players to use on their cars. These are primarily extremely bright colors, such as Hot pink, Really blue, and New Yeller, and span the entire rainbow spectrum of colors.


Flamethrower


Price: 450 Robux
Alternatively, redeem a code found on the Panwellz ROBLOX toy. 


This gamepass grants its purchaser a permanent flamethrower tool that can be found in their backpack. The flamethrower can be used by pressing and holding the left mouse button. It will launch flames towards wherever the mouse cursor is pointed. The range of the flames is short. It is otherwise functionally equivalent to the The Flamethrower crusher, being incapable of destroying certain parts of vehicles.


Materials


These gamepasses are purchased individually and grant one extra material for use on one's vehicle. They also confer a multiplier to the vehicle's base value that stacks additively with token bonuses (i.e. the vehicle's value is first calculated without the token, then the additional value is added after the token value multiplier is factored in.) If a vehicle has multiple slots with different materials, the most expensive material will be used to calculate the final added value. For example, if a vehicle has both the Neon and Platinum materials applied, the Platinum bonus will be used.


Neon Material


Unlocks the Neon material. Any vehicle that has the Neon material enabled in any slot will gain a 25% additive non-stacking bonus to its base value.


Silver Material


Unlocks the Silver material. Any vehicle that has the Silver material enabled in any slot will gain a 50% additive non-stacking bonus to its base value.


Gold Material


Unlocks the Gold material. Any vehicle that has the Gold material enabled in any slot will gain a 100% additive non-stacking bonus to its base value, doubling the vehicle's base value.


Platinum Material


Unlocks the Platinum material. Any vehicle that has the Platinum material enabled in any slot will gain a 200% additive non-stacking bonus to its base value, tripling the vehicle's base value.


Premium Crushers


This gamepass grants its purchaser access to the left bank of crushers on Row 4. The following crushers are unlocked, ordered from nearest to farthest:


These crushers are all notable for being able to completely and efficiently destroy even the largest vehicles.


Rocket Booster


This gamepass allows its owner to attach a rocket booster to any vehicle they have unlocked. The rocket booster is activated by pressing Q and functions exactly the same as its power-up equivalent. When PvP is turned on, its functions are the exact same, including the ability to knock the rocket booster off of vehicles. It cannot, however, be attached in Derby mode and will be automatically removed. It will also automatically remove itself whenever the player participates in Races. The booster itself is 9 parts, and the parts will be the same value as the vehicle it is attached to.


Rocket Launcher


This gamepass grants its owner a permanent rocket launcher tool that can be found in their backpack. It takes the form of the RPG-7V2, a Russian rocket propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. Clicking fires a rocket directly at where the cursor is pointed. On impact, it creates an explosion that ignites all parts in the blast radius as well as breaking them off of the vehicle.


Super Human


This gamepass allows its owner to run at double the speed of other players when outside of a vehicle (32 walkspeed instead of the default 16). Additionally, this makes it impossible for players to die to any crusher's effects. It will not protect them from being killed by a core explosion or falling out of a world due to a vehicle getting stuck in the ground. The invincibility can be toggled off in the game settings, but the doubled walkspeed will remain. It is most useful when coupled with another tool to allow players to break parts of vehicles inside of crushers that are normally impossible to get into, or when combined with the Energy Core Access to reach the core room faster. It is also useful for reaching the Escape Helicopter faster in the event that the player overshoots or simply can't reach the helicopter with their current vehicle.


Unlock All Crushers


This gamepass bypasses all Part requirements to enter all crushers. This effectively cuts out the grind to unlock crushers all the way to the end of a player's first token reset (50,000 total Parts). The value of this gamepass decreases dramatically as the player unlocks more crushers until eventually it is worthless. This gamepass also unlocks all of the crushers on Row 4, which would normally be unlocked by purchasing their respective gamepasses. When the player has already unlocked all crushers without this gamepass, it’s totally useless and a waste of robux.


VIP


The VIP gamepass grants access to all VIP vehicles in the game (denoted by purple labels). These vehicles must be unlocked by reaching the requisite Money requirement, at which point they can be crushed. This aspect of the gamepass gains value for players who have reset for 2 or more tokens, as certain VIP vehicles are at midpoints between two free vehicles that require 10-20 complete crushes in order to unlock the next vehicle.


This gamepass also unlocks five new crushers on the right side of Row 4. The crushers, from nearest to farthest, are as follows:
